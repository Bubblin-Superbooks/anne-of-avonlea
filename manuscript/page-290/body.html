<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But since I didn&rsquo;t, the next best thing is to celebrate my birthday in the spring. Priscilla is coming over Saturday and Jane will be home. We&rsquo;ll all four start off to the woods and spend a golden day making the acquaintance of the spring. We none of us really know her yet, but we&rsquo;ll meet her back there as we never can anywhere else. I want to explore all those fields and lonely places anyhow. I have a conviction that there are scores of beautiful nooks there that have never really been SEEN although they may have been LOOKED at. We&rsquo;ll make friends with wind and sky and sun, and bring home the spring in our hearts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It SOUNDS awfully nice,&rdquo; said Diana, with some inward distrust of Anne&rsquo;s magic of words. &ldquo;But won&rsquo;t it be very damp in some places yet?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
