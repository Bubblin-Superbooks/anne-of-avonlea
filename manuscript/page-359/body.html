<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Ever since you and I had that talk about praying going home from Sunday School that day, teacher . . . when you said we ought to pray about all our difficulties . . . I&rsquo;ve prayed every night that God would give me enough grace to enable me to eat every bit of my porridge in the mornings. But I&rsquo;ve never been able to do it yet, and whether it&rsquo;s because I have too little grace or too much porridge I really can&rsquo;t decide. Grandma says father was brought up on porridge, and it certainly did work well in his case, for you ought to see the shoulders he has. But sometimes,&rdquo; concluded Paul with a sigh and a meditative air &ldquo;I really think porridge will be the death of me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
