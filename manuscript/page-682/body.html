<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Welcome, Anne. I thought you&rsquo;d come today. You belong to the afternoon so it brought you. Things that belong together are sure to come together. What a lot of trouble that would save some people if they only knew it. But they don&rsquo;t . . . and so they waste beautiful energy moving heaven and earth to bring things together that DON&rsquo;T belong. And you, Paul . . . why, you&rsquo;ve grown! You&rsquo;re half a head taller than when you were here before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve begun to grow like pigweed in the night, as Mrs. Lynde says,&rdquo; said Paul, in frank delight over the fact. &ldquo;Grandma says it&rsquo;s the porridge taking effect at last. Perhaps it is. Goodness knows . . .&rdquo; Paul sighed deeply . . . &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve eaten enough to make anyone grow.</p></div> </div>
