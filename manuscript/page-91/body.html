She was an excellent target for teasing because she always took things so seriously. &ldquo;I shall never have a switch in my school, Mr. Harrison. Of course, I shall have to have a pointer, but I shall use it for pointing ONLY.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you mean to strap them instead? Well, I don&rsquo;t know but you&rsquo;re right. A switch stings more at the time but the strap smarts longer, that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall not use anything of the sort. I&rsquo;m not going to whip my pupils.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bless my soul,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Harrison in genuine astonishment, &ldquo;how do you lay out to keep order then?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
