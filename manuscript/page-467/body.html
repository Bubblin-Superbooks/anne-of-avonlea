<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Your mother was very lovely, Paul, and you look a little like her. But her eyes and hair are darker than yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My eyes are the same color as father&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Paul, flying about the room to heap all available cushions on the window seat, &ldquo;but father&rsquo;s hair is gray. He has lots of it, but it is gray. You see, father is nearly fifty. That&rsquo;s ripe old age, isn&rsquo;t it? But it&rsquo;s only OUTSIDE he&rsquo;s old. INSIDE he&rsquo;s just as young as anybody. Now, teacher, please sit here; and I&rsquo;ll sit at your feet. May I lay my head against your knee? That&rsquo;s the way my little mother and I used to sit. Oh, this is real splendid, I think.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
