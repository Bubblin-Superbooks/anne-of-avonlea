<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne leaned back in her chair one mild October evening and sighed. She was sitting at a table covered with text books and exercises, but the closely written sheets of paper before her had no apparent connection with studies or school work.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Gilbert, who had arrived at the open kitchen door just in time to hear the sigh.</p><p>Anne colored, and thrust her writing out of sight under some school compositions.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing very dreadful. I was just trying to write out some of my thoughts, as Professor Hamilton advised me, but I couldn&rsquo;t get them to please me. They seem so still and foolish directly they&rsquo;re written down on white paper with black ink. Fancies are like shadows . . . you can&rsquo;t cage them, they&rsquo;re such wayward, dancing things. But perhaps I&rsquo;ll learn the secret some day if I keep on trying.</p></div> </div>
