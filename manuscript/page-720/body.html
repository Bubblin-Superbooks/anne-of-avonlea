<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And after Grandma and Mary Joe had stopped being surprised he and Grandma came upstairs to look at me, not meaning to wake me up till morning. But I woke right up and saw father. I tell you I just sprang at him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With a hug like a bear&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Mr. Irving, putting his arms around Paul&rsquo;s shoulder smilingly. &ldquo;I hardly knew my boy, he had grown so big and brown and sturdy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which was the most pleased to see father, Grandma or I,&rdquo; continued Paul. &ldquo;Grandma&rsquo;s been in kitchen all day making the things father likes to eat. She wouldn&rsquo;t trust them to Mary Joe, she says. That&rsquo;s HER way of showing gladness. I like best just to sit and talk to father. But I&rsquo;m going to leave you for a little while now if you&rsquo;ll excuse me. I must get the cows for Mary Joe. That is one of my daily duties.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
