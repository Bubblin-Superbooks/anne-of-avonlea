<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Anne to herself that night, as she brushed her hair before her gilt framed mirror, &ldquo;I am glad Diana is so happy and satisfied. But when my turn comes . . . if it ever does . . . I do hope there&rsquo;ll be something a little more thrilling about it. But then Diana thought so too, once. I&rsquo;ve heard her say time and again she&rsquo;d never get engaged any poky commonplace way . . . he&rsquo;d HAVE to do something splendid to win her. But she has changed. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll change too. But I won&rsquo;t . . . and I&rsquo;m determined I won&rsquo;t. Oh, I think these engagements are dreadfully unsettling things when they happen to your intimate friends.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
