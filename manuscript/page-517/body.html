I don&rsquo;t know where we are exactly, but we must be all of three miles from Kimballs&rsquo; still.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then we can&rsquo;t get there by five, for it&rsquo;s half past four now,&rdquo; said Diana, with a despairing look at her watch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll arrive after they have had their tea, and they&rsquo;ll have all the bother of getting ours over again.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
