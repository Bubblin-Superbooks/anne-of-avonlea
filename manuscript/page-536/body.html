Her name isn&rsquo;t really Charlotta at all. It is . . . let me see . . . what is it? I THINK it&rsquo;s Leonora . . . yes, it IS Leonora. You see, it is this way. When mother died ten years ago I couldn&rsquo;t stay here alone . . . and I couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay the wages of a grown-up girl. So I got little Charlotta Bowman to come and stay with me for board and clothes. Her name really was Charlotta . . . she was Charlotta the First. She was just thirteen. She stayed with me till she was sixteen and then she went away to Boston, because she could do better there.</p></div> </div>
