You&rsquo;ve saved enough to put you through one year at Redmond and the money the stock brought in will do for another year . . . and there&rsquo;s scholarships and things you might win.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but I can&rsquo;t go, Marilla. Your eyes are better, of course; but I can&rsquo;t leave you alone with the twins. They need so much looking after.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be alone with them. That&rsquo;s what I meant to discuss with you. I had a long talk with Rachel tonight. Anne, she&rsquo;s feeling dreadful bad over a good many things. She&rsquo;s not left very well off.</p></div> </div>
