Back came the echoes, as if a host of pixy people were mimicking her laughter in the purple woodlands and along the fir-fringed points.</p><p>&ldquo;People always admire my echoes very much,&rdquo; said Miss Lavendar, as if the echoes were her personal property. &ldquo;I love them myself. They are very good company . . . with a little pretending. On calm evenings Charlotta the Fourth and I often sit out here and amuse ourselves with them. Charlotta, take back the horn and hang it carefully in its place.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
