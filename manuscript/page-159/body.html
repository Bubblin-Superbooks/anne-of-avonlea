Third cousinship is a pretty slim claim. And it will be a fearful responsibility to have two children of six years to look after . . . twins, at that.&rdquo;</p><p>Marilla had an idea that twins were just twice as bad as single children.</p><p>&ldquo;Twins are very interesting . . . at least one pair of them,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only when there are two or three pairs that it gets monotonous. And I think it would be real nice for you to have something to amuse you when I&rsquo;m away in school.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
