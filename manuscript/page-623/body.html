I&rsquo;m going to tell you the whole story, for I don&rsquo;t want you to think worse of me than I deserve . . . nor of Emily neither. But let&rsquo;s go out on the veranda. Everything is so fearful neat in here that it kind of makes me homesick. I suppose I&rsquo;ll get used to it after awhile but it eases me up to look at the yard. Emily hasn&rsquo;t had time to tidy it up yet.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
