And when spring comes we&rsquo;ll have a flower-bed made in the middle of it and plant geraniums.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; only we&rsquo;ll have to devise some way of getting old Mrs. Hiram Sloane to keep her cow off the road, or she&rsquo;ll eat our geraniums up,&rdquo; laughed Diana. &ldquo;I begin to see what you mean by educating public sentiment, Anne. There&rsquo;s the old Boulter house now. Did you ever see such a rookery? And perched right close to the road too. An old house with its windows gone always makes me think of something dead with its eyes picked out.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
