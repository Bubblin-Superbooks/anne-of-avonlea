Diana can&rsquo;t go because she has company, and I&rsquo;m sure Miss Lavendar will be looking for me tonight. It&rsquo;s a whole fortnight since I was there.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne had paid many a visit to Echo Lodge since that October day. Sometimes she and Diana drove around by the road; sometimes they walked through the woods. When Diana could not go Anne went alone. Between her and Miss Lavendar had sprung up one of those fervent, helpful friendships possible only between a woman who has kept the freshness of youth in her heart and soul, and a girl whose imagination and intuition supplied the place of experience.</p></div> </div>
