<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Along the eastern side ran a row of garden cherry trees, white as a snowdrift. There were traces of old paths still and a double line of rosebushes through the middle; but all the rest of the space was a sheet of yellow and white narcissi, in their airiest, most lavish, wind-swayed bloom above the lush green grasses.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, how perfectly lovely!&rdquo; three of the girls cried. Anne only gazed in eloquent silence.</p><p>&ldquo;How in the world does it happen that there ever was a garden back here?&rdquo; said Priscilla in amazement.</p><p>&ldquo;It must be Hester Gray&rsquo;s garden,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard mother speak of it but I never saw it before, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have supposed that it could be in existence still. You&rsquo;ve heard the story, Anne?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
