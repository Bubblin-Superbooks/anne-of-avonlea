<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I daresay Mrs. Morgan is a lot like other people,&rdquo; said Marilla drily, although she did feel a trifle excited herself. Mrs. Morgan was a famous woman and a visit from her was no commonplace occurrence. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be here to dinner, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; and oh, Marilla, may I cook every bit of the dinner myself? I want to feel that I can do something for the author of &lsquo;The Rosebud Garden,&rsquo; if it is only to cook a dinner for her. You won&rsquo;t mind, will you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodness, I&rsquo;m not so fond of stewing over a hot fire in July that it would vex me very much to have someone else do it. You&rsquo;re quite welcome to the job.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
