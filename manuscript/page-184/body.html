And I fell off into the pigpen and my dress got all dirty and the pig runned right over me. My dress was just awful but Davy said if I&rsquo;d stand under the pump he&rsquo;d wash it clean, and I did and he pumped water all over me but my dress ain&rsquo;t a bit cleaner and my pretty sash and shoes is all spoiled.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne did the honors of the table alone for the rest of the meal while Marilla went upstairs and redressed Dora in her old clothes. Davy was caught and sent to bed without any supper. Anne went to his room at twilight and talked to him seriously . . . a method in which she had great faith, not altogether unjustified by results. She told him she felt very badly over his conduct.</p></div> </div>
