A triumphant &ldquo;semi-annual examination&rdquo; was held and Anne&rsquo;s pupils acquitted themselves splendidly. At the close they gave her an address and a writing desk. All the girls and ladies present cried, and some of the boys had it cast up to them later on that they cried too, although they always denied it.</p><p>Mrs. Harmon Andrews, Mrs. Peter Sloane, and Mrs. William Bell walked home together and talked things over.</p><p>&ldquo;I do think it is such a pity Anne is leaving when the children seem so much attached to her,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Peter Sloane, who had a habit of sighing over everything and even finished off her jokes that way. &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; she added hastily, &ldquo;we all know we&rsquo;ll have a good teacher next year too.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
