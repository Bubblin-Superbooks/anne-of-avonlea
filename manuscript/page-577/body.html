<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I like Miss Lavendar,&rdquo; announced Paul, as they walked through the beech woods. &ldquo;I like the way she looked at me, and I like her stone house, and I like Charlotta the Fourth. I wish Grandma Irving had a Charlotta the Fourth instead of a Mary Joe. I feel sure Charlotta the Fourth wouldn&rsquo;t think I was wrong in my upper story when I told her what I think about things. Wasn&rsquo;t that a splendid tea we had, teacher? Grandma says a boy shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking about what he gets to eat, but he can&rsquo;t help it sometimes when he is real hungry. YOU know, teacher. I don&rsquo;t think Miss Lavendar would make a boy eat porridge for breakfast if he didn&rsquo;t like it. She&rsquo;d get things for him he did like. But of course&rdquo; . . . Paul was nothing if not fair-minded . . . &ldquo;that mightn&rsquo;t be very good for him. It&rsquo;s very nice for a change though, teacher. YOU know.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
