My mouth has been watering for some more of your grandma&rsquo;s delicious shortbread ever since I had tea here before.&rdquo;</p><p>Paul looked very sober.</p><p>&ldquo;If it depended on me, teacher,&rdquo; he said, standing before Anne with his hands in his pockets and his beautiful little face shadowed with sudden care, &ldquo;You should have shortbread with a right good will. But it depends on Mary Joe. I heard Grandma tell her before she left that she wasn&rsquo;t to give me any shortcake because it was too rich for little boys&rsquo; stomachs. But maybe Mary Joe will cut some for you if I promise I won&rsquo;t eat any. Let us hope for the best.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
