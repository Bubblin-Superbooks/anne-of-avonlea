My wife got a telegram today that her sister from Montreal is coming tonight and she&rsquo;s gone to the train to meet her and left orders for me to make a cake for tea. She writ out the recipe and told me what to do but I&rsquo;ve clean forgot half the directions already. And it says, &lsquo;flavor according to taste.</p></div> </div>
