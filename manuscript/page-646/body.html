Well, she has, of course; but I think I&rsquo;d rather put up with far worse faults than see Rachel go away from Avonlea. I&rsquo;d miss her terrible. She&rsquo;s the only close friend I&rsquo;ve got here and I&rsquo;d be lost without her. We&rsquo;ve been neighbors for forty-five years and we&rsquo;ve never had a quarrel . . . though we came rather near it that time you flew at Mrs. Rachel for calling you homely and redhaired. Do you remember, Anne?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
