And the worst sign of all, Miss Shirley, ma&rsquo;am . . .&rdquo; Charlotta the Fourth lowered her voice as if she were about to tell some exceedingly weird and awful symptom indeed . . . &ldquo;is that she never gets cross now when I breaks things. Why, Miss Shirley, ma&rsquo;am, yesterday I bruk her green and yaller bowl that&rsquo;s always stood on the bookcase. Her grandmother brought it out from England and Miss Lavendar was awful choice of it. I was dusting it just as careful, Miss Shirley, ma&rsquo;am, and it slipped out, so fashion, afore I could grab holt of it, and bruk into about forty millyun pieces. I tell you I was sorry and scared. I thought Miss Lavendar would scold me awful, ma&rsquo;am; and I&rsquo;d ruther she had than take it the way she did. She just come in and hardly looked at it and said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no matter, Charlotta.</p></div> </div>
