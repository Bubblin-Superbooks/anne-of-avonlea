As a rule, I don&rsquo;t like to be kissed. Boys don&rsquo;t. You know, Miss Lewis. But I think I rather like to have you kiss me. And of course I&rsquo;ll come to see you again. I think I&rsquo;d like to have you for a particular friend of mine, if you don&rsquo;t object.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I . . . I don&rsquo;t think I shall object,&rdquo; said Miss Lavendar. She turned and went in very quickly; but a moment later she was waving a gay and smiling good-bye to them from the window.</p></div> </div>
