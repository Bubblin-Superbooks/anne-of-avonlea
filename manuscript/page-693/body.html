<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It seemed so easy when you watched Anne. Charlotta the Fourth admired Anne wholeheartedly. It was not that she thought her so very handsome. Diana Barry&rsquo;s beauty of crimson cheek and black curls was much more to Charlotta the Fourth&rsquo;s taste than Anne&rsquo;s moonshine charm of luminous gray eyes and the pale, everchanging roses of her cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;d rather look like you than be pretty,&rdquo; she told Anne sincerely.</p><p>Anne laughed, sipped the honey from the tribute, and cast away the sting. She was used to taking her compliments mixed. Public opinion never agreed on Anne&rsquo;s looks. People who had heard her called handsome met her and were disappointed. People who had heard her called plain saw her and wondered where other people&rsquo;s eyes were. Anne herself would never believe that she had any claim to beauty.</p></div> </div>
