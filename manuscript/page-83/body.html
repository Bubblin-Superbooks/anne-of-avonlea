Miss Stacy never whipped any of us and she had perfect order; and Mr. Phillips was always whipping and he had no order at all. No, if I can&rsquo;t get along without whipping I shall not try to teach school. There are better ways of managing. I shall try to win my pupils&rsquo; affections and then they will WANT to do what I tell them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
