I feel as if there was a dreadful lump in my throat. I&rsquo;d have cried coming home from school if Jake Donnell hadn&rsquo;t been watching me. I believe I will cry after I go to bed.

I&rsquo;m going to need all my strength of mind to bear up against this, Grandma, and I won&rsquo;t have any left to grapple with porridge. Oh Grandma, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll do when my beautiful teacher goes away. Milty Boulter says he bets Jane Andrews will get the school. I suppose Miss Andrews is very nice.
