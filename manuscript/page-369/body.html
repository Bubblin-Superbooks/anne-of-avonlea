<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Pretty well. We plan to finish the Virgil tonight . . . there are only twenty lines to do. Then we are not going to study any more until September.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think you will ever get to college?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Anne looked dreamily afar to the opal-tinted horizon. &ldquo;Marilla&rsquo;s eyes will never be much better than they are now, although we are so thankful to think that they will not get worse. And then there are the twins . . . somehow I don&rsquo;t believe their uncle will ever really send for them. Perhaps college may be around the bend in the road, but I haven&rsquo;t got to the bend yet and I don&rsquo;t think much about it lest I might grow discontented.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
