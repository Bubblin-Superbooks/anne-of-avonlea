<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> in the morning and at the noontide and at the twilight. I love you when you laugh and when you sigh . . . even when you look disdainful. I never saw you look cross though Anthony Pye says you always look so but I don&rsquo;t wonder you look cross at him for he deserves it. I love you in every dress . . . you seem more adorable in each new dress than the last.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dearest teacher, good night. The sun has set and the stars are shining . . . stars that are as bright and beautiful as your eyes. I kiss your hands and face, my sweet. May God watch over you and protect you from all harm.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your afecksionate pupil,</p></div> </div>
