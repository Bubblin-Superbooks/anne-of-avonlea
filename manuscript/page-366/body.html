I haven&rsquo;t done what I meant to do when I began to teach last fall. I haven&rsquo;t lived up to my ideals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;None of us ever do,&rdquo; said Mrs. Allan with a sigh. &ldquo;But then, Anne, you know what Lowell says, &lsquo;Not failure but low aim is crime.&rsquo; We must have ideals and try to live up to them, even if we never quite succeed. Life would be a sorry business without them. With them it&rsquo;s grand and great. Hold fast to your ideals, Anne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall try. But I have to let go most of my theories,&rdquo; said Anne, laughing a little.</p></div> </div>
