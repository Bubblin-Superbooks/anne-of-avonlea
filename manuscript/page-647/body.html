How I hated poor Mrs. Rachel at that moment!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And then that &lsquo;apology&rsquo; you made her. Well, you were a handful, in all conscience, Anne. I did feel so puzzled and bewildered how to manage you. Matthew understood you better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Matthew understood everything,&rdquo; said Anne softly, as she always spoke of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I think it could be managed so that Rachel and I wouldn&rsquo;t clash at all. It always seemed to me that the reason two women can&rsquo;t get along in one house is that they try to share the same kitchen and get in each other&rsquo;s way. Now, if Rachel came here, she could have the north gable for her bedroom and the spare room for a kitchen as well as not, for we don&rsquo;t really need a spare room at all.</p></div> </div>
