And Miss Lavendar ain&rsquo;t to be trusted to do a thing. I was thankful when Mr. Irving came a few minutes ago and took her off for a walk in the woods. Courting&rsquo;s all right in its place, Miss Shirley, ma&rsquo;am, but if you try to mix it up with cooking and scouring everything&rsquo;s spoiled. That&rsquo;s MY opinion, Miss Shirley, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
