<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s got the twins with her, . . . yes, there&rsquo;s Davy leaning over the dashboard grabbing at the pony&rsquo;s tail and Marilla jerking him back. Dora&rsquo;s sitting up on the seat as prim as you please. She always looks as if she&rsquo;d just been starched and ironed. Well, poor Marilla is going to have her hands full this winter and no mistake. Still, I don&rsquo;t see that she could do anything less than take them, under the circumstances, and she&rsquo;ll have Anne to help her. Anne&rsquo;s tickled to death over the whole business, and she has a real knacky way with children, I must say. Dear me, it doesn&rsquo;t seem a day since poor Matthew brought Anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of Marilla bringing up a child. And now she has adopted twins. You&rsquo;re never safe from being surprised till you&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
