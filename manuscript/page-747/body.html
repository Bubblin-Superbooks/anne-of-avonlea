<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The last Wednesday in August. They are to be married in the garden under the honeysuckle trellis . . . the very spot where Mr. Irving proposed to her twenty-five years ago. Marilla, that IS romantic, even in prose. There&rsquo;s to be nobody there except Mrs. Irving and Paul and Gilbert and Diana and I, and Miss Lavendar&rsquo;s cousins. And they will leave on the six o&rsquo;clock train for a trip to the Pacific coast. When they come back in the fall Paul and Charlotta the Fourth are to go up to Boston to live with them. But Echo Lodge is to be left just as it is. . . only of course they&rsquo;ll sell the hens and cow, and board up the windows . . . and every summer they&rsquo;re coming down to live in it. I&rsquo;m so glad. It would have hurt me dreadfully next winter at Redmond to think of that dear stone house all stripped and deserted, with empty rooms . . .</p></div> </div>
