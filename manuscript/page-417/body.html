<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; sighed Anne, laying the letter down on the red sandstone step of the back porch, where she was sitting, while the twilight rained down out of a dappled sky, &ldquo;I always thought it was too good to be true that Mrs. Morgan should really come. But there . . . that speech sounds as pessimistic as Miss Eliza Andrews and I&rsquo;m ashamed of making it. After all, it was NOT too good to be true . . . things just as good and far better are coming true for me all the time. And I suppose the events of today have a funny side too. Perhaps when Diana and I are old and gray we shall be able to laugh over them. But I feel that I can&rsquo;t expect to do it before then, for it has truly been a bitter disappointment.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
