<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Pretty well . . . and that reminds me. Mrs. Allan thinks it would be nice to fix up a booth like an old-time kitchen and serve a supper of baked beans, doughnuts, pie, and so on. We&rsquo;re collecting old-fashioned fixings everywhere. Mrs. Simon Fletcher is going to lend us her mother&rsquo;s braided rugs and Mrs. Levi Boulter some old chairs and Aunt Mary Shaw will lend us her cupboard with the glass doors. I suppose Marilla will let us have her brass candlesticks? And we want all the old dishes we can get. Mrs. Allan is specially set on having a real blue willow ware platter if we can find one. But nobody seems to have one. Do you know where we could get one?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
