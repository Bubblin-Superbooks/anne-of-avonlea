Eliza had to go home today . . . her son isn&rsquo;t well and she felt she couldn&rsquo;t stay any longer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve finished these exercises I&rsquo;ll run down and chat awhile with Mrs. Lynde,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;I had intended to study some Latin composition tonight but it can wait.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
