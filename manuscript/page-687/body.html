<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But teacher here said once that every really beautiful thought was religious, no matter what it was about, or what day we thought it on. But I feel sure Grandma thinks that sermons and Sunday School lessons are the only things you can think truly religious thoughts about. And when it comes to a difference of opinion between Grandma and teacher I don&rsquo;t know what to do. In my heart&rdquo; . . . Paul laid his hand on his breast and raised very serious blue eyes to Miss Lavendar&rsquo;s immediately sympathetic face . . . &ldquo;I agree with teacher. But then, you see, Grandma has brought father up HER way and made a brilliant success of him; and teacher has never brought anybody up yet, though she&rsquo;s helping with Davy and Dora. But you can&rsquo;t tell how they&rsquo;ll turn out till they ARE grown up. So sometimes I feel as if it might be safer to go by Grandma&rsquo;s opinions.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
