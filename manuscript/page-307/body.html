<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mrs. Lynde said he was taking a fearful risk in marrying a Yankee, and it&rsquo;s certain that Hester was very delicate and a very poor housekeeper; but mother says she was very pretty and sweet and Jordan just worshipped the ground she walked on. Well, Mr. Gray gave Jordan this farm and he built a little house back here and Jordan and Hester lived in it for four years. She never went out much and hardly anybody went to see her except mother and Mrs. Lynde. Jordan made her this garden and she was crazy about it and spent most of her time in it. She wasn&rsquo;t much of a housekeeper but she had a knack with flowers. And then she got sick. Mother says she thinks she was in consumption before she ever came here. She never really laid up but just grew weaker and weaker all the time. Jordan wouldn&rsquo;t have anybody to wait on her. He did it all himself and mother says he was as tender and gentle as a woman.</p></div> </div>
