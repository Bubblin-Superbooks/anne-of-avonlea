<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A cracked mirror hung by the chamber window and in an unlucky moment Anne looked into it. There were those seven freckles on her nose, more rampant than ever, or so it seemed in the glare of light from the unshaded window.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot to rub that lotion on last night,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better run down to the pantry and do it now.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne had already suffered many things trying to remove those freckles. On one occasion the entire skin had peeled off her nose but the freckles remained. A few days previously she had found a recipe for a freckle lotion in a magazine and, as the ingredients were within her reach, she straightway compounded it, much to the disgust of Marilla, who thought that if Providence had placed freckles on your nose it was your bounden duty to leave them there.</p></div> </div>
