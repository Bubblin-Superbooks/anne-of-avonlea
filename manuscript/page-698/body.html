<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Charlotta shook her head, with its rampant bows, disconsolately.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Miss Shirley, ma&rsquo;am. Miss Lavendar hates visiting. She&rsquo;s only got three relations she ever visits and she says she just goes to see them as a family duty. Last time when she come home she said she wasn&rsquo;t going to visit for family duty no more. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come home in love with loneliness, Charlotta,&rsquo; she says to me, &lsquo;and I never want to stray from my own vine and fig tree again. My relations try so hard to make an old lady of me and it has a bad effect on me.&rsquo; Just like that, Miss Shirley, ma&rsquo;am. &lsquo;It has a very bad effect on me.&rsquo; So I don&rsquo;t think it would do any good to coax her to go visiting.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
