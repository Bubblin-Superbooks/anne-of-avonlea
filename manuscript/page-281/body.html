When Anne&rsquo;s sobs grew quieter she said, very gently for her,</p><p>&ldquo;You take things too much to heart, Anne. We all make mistakes . . . but people forget them. And Jonah days come to everybody. As for Anthony Pye, why need you care if he does dislike you? He is the only one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I want everybody to love me and it hurts me so when anybody doesn&rsquo;t. And Anthony never will now. Oh, I just made an idiot of myself today, Marilla. I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole story.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
