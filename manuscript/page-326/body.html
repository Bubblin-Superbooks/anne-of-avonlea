<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Davy Keith, don&rsquo;t you know that it is very wrong of you to be eating that jam, when you were told never to meddle with anything in THAT closet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I knew it was wrong,&rdquo; admitted Davy uncomfortably, &ldquo;but plum jam is awful nice, Anne. I just peeped in and it looked so good I thought I&rsquo;d take just a weeny taste. I stuck my finger in . . .&rdquo; Anne groaned . . . &ldquo;and licked it clean. And it was so much gooder than I&rsquo;d ever thought that I got a spoon and just SAILED IN.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne gave him such a serious lecture on the sin of stealing plum jam that Davy became conscience stricken and promised with repentant kisses never to do it again.</p></div> </div>
