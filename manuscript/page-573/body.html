MY little dream-boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you would like to see Paul I&rsquo;ll bring him through with me sometime,&rdquo; said Anne.</p><p>&ldquo;I would like it . . . but not too soon. I want to get used to the thought. There might be more pain than pleasure in it . . . if he looked too much like Stephen . . . or if he didn&rsquo;t look enough like him. In a month&rsquo;s time you may bring him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
