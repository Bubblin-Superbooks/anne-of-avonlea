<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; said Davy, sitting up in bed and propping his chin on his hands, &ldquo;Anne, where is sleep? People go to sleep every night, and of course I know it&rsquo;s the place where I do the things I dream, but I want to know WHERE it is and how I get there and back without knowing anything about it . . . and in my nighty too. Where is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Anne was kneeling at the west gable window watching the sunset sky that was like a great flower with petals of crocus and a heart of fiery yellow. She turned her head at Davy&rsquo;s question and answered dreamily,</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Over the mountains of the moon, Down the valley of the shadow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
