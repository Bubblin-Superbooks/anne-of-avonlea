She did not feel able to cope with Davy just then. It had been a hard day for her, what with the funeral and the long drive. At that moment she looked forward to the future with a pessimism that would have done credit to Eliza Andrews herself.</p><p>The twins were not noticeably alike, although both were fair. Dora had long sleek curls that never got out of order. Davy had a crop of fuzzy little yellow ringlets all over his round head. Dora&rsquo;s hazel eyes were gentle and mild; Davy&rsquo;s were as roguish and dancing as an elf&rsquo;s.</p></div> </div>
