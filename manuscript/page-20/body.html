<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Trouble, is it? Bless my soul, trouble enough, I should think. The trouble is, miss, that I found that Jersey cow of your aunt&rsquo;s in my oats again, not half an hour ago. The third time, mark you. I found her in last Tuesday and I found her in yesterday. I came here and told your aunt not to let it occur again. She has let it occur again. Where&rsquo;s your aunt, miss? I just want to see her for a minute and give her a piece of my mind . . . a piece of J. A. Harrison&rsquo;s mind, miss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you mean Miss Marilla Cuthbert, she is not my aunt, and she has gone down to East Grafton to see a distant relative of hers who is very ill,&rdquo; said Anne, with due increase of dignity at every word. &ldquo;I am very sorry that my cow should have broken into your oats . . .</p></div> </div>
