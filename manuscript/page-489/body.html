<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to help Mr. Harrison haul dulse this morning,&rdquo; announced Davy. &ldquo;He asked me to, and I guess he&rsquo;ll ask me to dinner too. Mr. Harrison is an awful kind man. He&rsquo;s a real sociable man. I hope I&rsquo;ll be like him when I grow up. I mean BEHAVE like him . . . I don&rsquo;t want to LOOK like him. But I guess there&rsquo;s no danger, for Mrs. Lynde says I&rsquo;m a very handsome child. Do you s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;ll last, Anne? I want to know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I daresay it will,&rdquo; said Anne gravely. &ldquo;You ARE a handsome boy, Davy,&rdquo; . . . Marilla looked volumes of disapproval . . . &ldquo;but you must live up to it and be just as nice and gentlemanly as you look to be.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
