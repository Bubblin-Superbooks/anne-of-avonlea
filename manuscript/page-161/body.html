If we don&rsquo;t take them we don&rsquo;t know who will, nor what kind of influences may surround them. Suppose Mrs. Keith&rsquo;s next door neighbors, the Sprotts, were to take them. Mrs. Lynde says Henry Sprott is the most profane man that ever lived and you can&rsquo;t believe a word his children say. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be dreadful to have the twins learn anything like that? Or suppose they went to the Wiggins&rsquo;. Mrs. Lynde says that Mr. Wiggins sells everything off the place that can be sold and brings his family up on skim milk. You wouldn&rsquo;t like your relations to be starved, even if they were only third cousins, would you? It seems to me, Marilla, that it is our duty to take them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
