<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One evening at sunset, Jane Andrews, Gilbert Blythe, and Anne Shirley were lingering by a fence in the shadow of gently swaying spruce boughs, where a wood cut known as the Birch Path joined the main road. Jane had been up to spend the afternoon with Anne, who walked part of the way home with her; at the fence they met Gilbert, and all three were now talking about the fateful morrow; for that morrow was the first of September and the schools would open. Jane would go to Newbridge and Gilbert to White Sands.</p><p>&ldquo;You both have the advantage of me,&rdquo; sighed Anne. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to teach children who don&rsquo;t know you, but I have to teach my own old schoolmates, and Mrs. Lynde says she&rsquo;s afraid they won&rsquo;t respect me as they would a stranger unless I&rsquo;m very cross from the first.</p></div> </div>
