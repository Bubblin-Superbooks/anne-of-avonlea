<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I shut my Jersey cow up in our pen yesterday. This morning I went to Carmody and when I came back I saw a Jersey cow in your oats. Diana and I chased her out and you can&rsquo;t imagine what a hard time we had. I was so dreadfully wet and tired and vexed&mdash;and Mr. Shearer came by that very minute and offered to buy the cow. I sold her to him on the spot for twenty dollars. It was wrong of me. I should have waited and consulted Marilla, of course. But I&rsquo;m dreadfully given to doing things without thinking&mdash;everybody who knows me will tell you that. Mr. Shearer took the cow right away to ship her on the afternoon train.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
