<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I was all riled up, Anne, and I said she might stay till doomsday if she waited for that; and I stuck to it. I packed up her belongings and sent them after her. It made an awful lot of talk . . . Scottsford was pretty near as bad as Avonlea for gossip . . . and everybody sympathized with Emily. It kept me all cross and cantankerous and I saw I&rsquo;d have to get out or I&rsquo;d never have any peace. I concluded I&rsquo;d come to the Island. I&rsquo;d been here when I was a boy and I liked it; but Emily had always said she wouldn&rsquo;t live in a place where folks were scared to walk out after dark for fear they&rsquo;d fall off the edge. So, just to be contrary, I moved over here. And that&rsquo;s all there is to it.</p></div> </div>
