<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Another day I asked them all to tell me the naughtiest thing they had ever done. I couldn&rsquo;t get the older ones to do so, but the third class answered quite freely. Eliza Bell had &lsquo;set fire to her aunt&rsquo;s carded rolls.&rsquo; Asked if she meant to do it she said, &lsquo;not altogether.&rsquo; She just tried a little end to see how it would burn and the whole bundle blazed up in a jiffy. Emerson Gillis had spent ten cents for candy when he should have put it in his missionary box. Annetta Bell&rsquo;s worst crime was &lsquo;eating some blueberries that grew in the graveyard.&rsquo; Willie White had &lsquo;slid down the sheephouse roof a lot of times with his Sunday trousers on.&rsquo; &lsquo;But I was punished for it &lsquo;cause I had to wear patched pants to Sunday School all summer, and when you&rsquo;re punished for a thing you don&rsquo;t have to repent of it,&rsquo; declared Willie.</p></div> </div>
