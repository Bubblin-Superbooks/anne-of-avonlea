<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>s nobody like my own Diana after all. Do you remember that evening we first met, Diana, and &lsquo;swore&rsquo; eternal friendship in your garden? We&rsquo;ve kept that &lsquo;oath,&rsquo; I think . . . we&rsquo;ve never had a quarrel nor even a coolness. I shall never forget the thrill that went over me the day you told me you loved me. I had had such a lonely, starved heart all through my childhood. I&rsquo;m just beginning to realize how starved and lonely it really was. Nobody cared anything for me or wanted to be bothered with me. I should have been miserable if it hadn&rsquo;t been for that strange little dream-life of mine, wherein I imagined all the friends and love I craved. But when I came to Green Gables everything was changed. And then I met you. You don&rsquo;t know what your friendship meant to me. I want to thank you here and now, dear, for the warm and true affection you&rsquo;ve always given me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
