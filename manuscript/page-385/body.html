I&rsquo;ll make the pies and lady fingers tomorrow and do up my white muslin dress. And I must tell Diana tonight, for she&rsquo;ll want to do up hers. Mrs. Morgan&rsquo;s heroines are nearly always dressed in white muslin, and Diana and I have always resolved that that was what we would wear if we ever met her. It will be such a delicate compliment, don&rsquo;t you think? Davy, dear, you mustn&rsquo;t poke peapods into the cracks of the floor. I must ask Mr. and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy to dinner, too, for they&rsquo;re all very anxious to meet Mrs. Morgan. It&rsquo;s so fortunate she&rsquo;s coming while Miss Stacy is here. Davy dear, don&rsquo;t sail the peapods in the water bucket . . .</p></div> </div>
