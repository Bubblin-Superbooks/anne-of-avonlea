She would not give him any dinner but allowed him a plain tea of bread and milk. Anne carried it to him and sat sorrowfully by him while he ate it with an unrepentant relish. But Anne&rsquo;s mournful eyes troubled him.</p><p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; he said reflectively, &ldquo;that Paul Irving wouldn&rsquo;t have dropped a caterpillar down a girl&rsquo;s neck in church, would he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anne sadly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m kind of sorry I did it, then,&rdquo; conceded Davy. &ldquo;But it was such a jolly big caterpillar . . . I picked him up on the church steps just as we went in. It seemed a pity to waste him. And say, wasn&rsquo;t it fun to hear that girl yell?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
