<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Some are born old maids, some achieve old maidenhood, and some have old maidenhood thrust upon them,&rdquo; parodied Miss Lavendar whimsically.</p><p>&ldquo;You are one of those who have achieved it then,&rdquo; laughed Anne, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve done it so beautifully that if every old maid were like you they would come into the fashion, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I always like to do things as well as possible,&rdquo; said Miss Lavendar meditatively, &ldquo;and since an old maid I had to be I was determined to be a very nice one. People say I&rsquo;m odd; but it&rsquo;s just because I follow my own way of being an old maid and refuse to copy the traditional pattern. Anne, did anyone ever tell you anything about Stephen Irving and me?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
