<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It seems they mortgaged the farm eight years ago to give the youngest boy a start when he went west; and they&rsquo;ve never been able to pay much more than the interest since. And then of course Thomas&rsquo; illness has cost a good deal, one way or another. The farm will have to be sold and Rachel thinks there&rsquo;ll be hardly anything left after the bills are settled. She says she&rsquo;ll have to go and live with Eliza and it&rsquo;s breaking her heart to think of leaving Avonlea. A woman of her age doesn&rsquo;t make new friends and interests easy. And, Anne, as she talked about it the thought came to me that I would ask her to come and live with me, but I thought I ought to talk it over with you first before I said anything to her. If I had Rachel living with me you could go to college. How do you feel about it?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
