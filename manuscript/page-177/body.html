He trotted obediently upstairs with Anne.</p><p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m grown up the very first thing I&rsquo;m going to do is stay up ALL night just to see what it would be like,&rdquo; he told her confidentially.</p><p>In after years Marilla never thought of that first week of the twins&rsquo; sojourn at Green Gables without a shiver. Not that it really was so much worse than the weeks that followed it; but it seemed so by reason of its novelty. There was seldom a waking minute of any day when Davy was not in mischief or devising it; but his first notable exploit occurred two days after his arrival, on Sunday morning . . . a fine, warm day, as hazy and mild as September. Anne dressed him for church while Marilla attended to Dora. Davy at first objected strongly to having his face washed.</p></div> </div>
