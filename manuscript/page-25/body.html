They discussed the matter at the tea table.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad when the auction is over,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;It is too much responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that unreliable Martin to look after them. He has never come back yet and he promised that he would certainly be back last night if I&rsquo;d give him the day off to go to his aunt&rsquo;s funeral. I don&rsquo;t know how many aunts he has got, I am sure. That&rsquo;s the fourth that&rsquo;s died since he hired here a year ago. I&rsquo;ll be more than thankful when the crop is in and Mr. Barry takes over the farm.</p></div> </div>
