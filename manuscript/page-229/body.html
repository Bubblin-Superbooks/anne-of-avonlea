<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be too hard on the child,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;I daresay nobody ever did tell him it was wrong to tell lies, and those Sprott children were no fit companions for him. Poor Mary was too sick to train him properly and I presume you couldn&rsquo;t expect a six-year-old child to know things like that by instinct. I suppose we&rsquo;ll just have to assume he doesn&rsquo;t know ANYTHING right and begin at the beginning. But he&rsquo;ll have to be punished for shutting Dora up, and I can&rsquo;t think of any way except to send him to bed without his supper and we&rsquo;ve done that so often. Can&rsquo;t you suggest something else, Anne? I should think you ought to be able to, with that imagination you&rsquo;re always talking of.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
