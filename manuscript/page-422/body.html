I think I hear Rachel pronouncing on it. There&rsquo;s Mr. Harrison driving away somewhere. Do you suppose there is any truth in the gossip that Mr. Harrison is going to see Isabella Andrews?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure there isn&rsquo;t. He just called there one evening on business with Mr. Harmon Andrews and Mrs. Lynde saw him and said she knew he was courting because he had a white collar on. I don&rsquo;t believe Mr. Harrison will ever marry. He seems to have a prejudice against marriage.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
