He pulled them to a halt opposite the school.</p><p>&ldquo;Guess Uncle Abe&rsquo;s hit it for once in his life, Anne,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;His storm&rsquo;s coming a leetle ahead of time. Did ye ever see the like of that cloud? Here, all you young ones, that are going my way, pile in, and those that ain&rsquo;t scoot for the post office if ye&rsquo;ve more&rsquo;n a quarter of a mile to go, and stay there till the shower&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne caught Davy and Dora by the hands and flew down the hill, along the Birch Path, and past Violet Vale and Willowmere, as fast as the twins&rsquo; fat legs could go.</p></div> </div>
