It was very warm and windless, and the dust on the road was such as might have been expected after six weeks of dry weather.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I do wish it would rain soon,&rdquo; sighed Anne. &ldquo;Everything is so parched up. The poor fields just seem pitiful to me and the trees seem to be stretching out their hands pleading for rain. As for my garden, it hurts me every time I go into it. I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t complain about a garden when the farmers&rsquo; crops are suffering so.</p></div> </div>
