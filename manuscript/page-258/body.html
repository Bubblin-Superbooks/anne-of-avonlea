You laugh at me because I think Paul is a genius but I am sure his letter will convince you that he is a very uncommon child. Paul lives away down near the shore with his grandmother and he has no playmates . . . no real playmates. You remember our School Management professor told us that we must not have &lsquo;favorites&rsquo; among our pupils, but I can&rsquo;t help loving Paul Irving the best of all mine. I don&rsquo;t think it does any harm, though, for everybody loves Paul, even Mrs. Lynde, who says she could never have believed she&rsquo;d get so fond of a Yankee. The other boys in school like him too.</p></div> </div>
