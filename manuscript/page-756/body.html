<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I suppose, Anne, you must think it&rsquo;s funny I should like Fred so well when he&rsquo;s so different from the kind of man I&rsquo;ve always said I would marry . . . the tall, slender kind? But somehow I wouldn&rsquo;t want Fred to be tall and slender . . . because, don&rsquo;t you see, he wouldn&rsquo;t be Fred then. Of course,&rdquo; added Diana rather dolefully, &ldquo;we will be a dreadfully pudgy couple. But after all that&rsquo;s better than one of us being short and fat and the other tall and lean, like Morgan Sloane and his wife. Mrs. Lynde says it always makes her think of the long and short of it when she sees them together.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
