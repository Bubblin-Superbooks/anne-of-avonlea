And I don&rsquo;t see how I can ever look those children in the face again. I feel that I have humiliated myself to the very dust. You don&rsquo;t know how cross and hateful and horrid I was. I can&rsquo;t forget the expression in Paul Irving&rsquo;s eyes . . . he looked so surprised and disappointed. Oh, Marilla, I HAVE tried so hard to be patient and to win Anthony&rsquo;s liking . . . and now it has all gone for nothing.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
