I shall miss you so much. Oh, sometimes, I think it is of no use to make friends. They only go out of your life after awhile and leave a hurt that is worse than the emptiness before they came.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds like something Miss Eliza Andrews might say but never Miss Lavendar,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;NOTHING is worse than emptiness . . . and I&rsquo;m not going out of your life. There are such things as letters and vacations. Dearest, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re looking a little pale and tired.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
