The Tory government ran the road through when they were in power just to show they were doing something.&rdquo;</p><p>Diana&rsquo;s father was a Liberal, for which reason she and Anne never discussed politics. Green Gables folk had always been Conservatives.</p><p>Finally the girls came to the old Copp homestead . . . a place of such exceeding external neatness that even Green Gables would have suffered by contrast. The house was a very old-fashioned one, situated on a slope, which fact had necessitated the building of a stone basement under one end.</p></div> </div>
