<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, I should like to see you go to college, Anne; but if you never do, don&rsquo;t be discontented about it. We make our own lives wherever we are, after all . . . college can only help us to do it more easily. They are broad or narrow according to what we put into them, not what we get out. Life is rich and full here . . . everywhere . . . if we can only learn how to open our whole hearts to its richness and fulness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I understand what you mean,&rdquo; said Anne thoughtfully, &ldquo;and I know I have so much to feel thankful for . . . oh, so much . . . my work, and Paul Irving, and the dear twins, and all my friends. Do you know, Mrs. Allan, I&rsquo;m so thankful for friendship. It beautifies life so much.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
