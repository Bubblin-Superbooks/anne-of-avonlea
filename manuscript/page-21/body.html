Matthew gave her to me three years ago when she was a little calf and he bought her from Mr. Bell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, miss! Sorry isn&rsquo;t going to help matters any. You&rsquo;d better go and look at the havoc that animal has made in my oats . . . trampled them from center to circumference, miss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; repeated Anne firmly, &ldquo;but perhaps if you kept your fences in better repair Dolly might not have broken in. It is your part of the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and I noticed the other day that it was not in very good condition.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
