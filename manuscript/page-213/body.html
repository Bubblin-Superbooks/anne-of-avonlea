<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I always imagine I&rsquo;m something very brilliant and triumphant and splendid . . . a great prima donna or a Red Cross nurse or a queen. Last night I was a queen. It&rsquo;s really splendid to imagine you are a queen. You have all the fun of it without any of the inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to, which you couldn&rsquo;t in real life. But here in the woods I like best to imagine quite different things . . . I&rsquo;m a dryad living in an old pine, or a little brown wood-elf hiding under a crinkled leaf. That white birch you caught me kissing is a sister of mine. The only difference is, she&rsquo;s a tree and I&rsquo;m a girl, but that&rsquo;s no real difference. Where are you going, Diana?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
