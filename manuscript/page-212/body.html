<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Anne Shirley, you&rsquo;re only pretending to be grown up. I believe when you&rsquo;re alone you&rsquo;re as much a little girl as you ever were.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, one can&rsquo;t get over the habit of being a little girl all at once,&rdquo; said Anne gaily. &ldquo;You see, I was little for fourteen years and I&rsquo;ve only been grown-uppish for scarcely three. I&rsquo;m sure I shall always feel like a child in the woods. These walks home from school are almost the only time I have for dreaming . . . except the half-hour or so before I go to sleep. I&rsquo;m so busy with teaching and studying and helping Marilla with the twins that I haven&rsquo;t another moment for imagining things. You don&rsquo;t know what splendid adventures I have for a little while after I go to bed in the east gable every night.</p></div> </div>
