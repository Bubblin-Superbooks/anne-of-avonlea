<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, this is a day left over from Eden, isn&rsquo;t it, Diana?&rdquo; . . . and Anne sighed for sheer happiness. &ldquo;The air has magic in it. Look at the purple in the cup of the harvest valley, Diana. And oh, do smell the dying fir! It&rsquo;s coming up from that little sunny hollow where Mr. Eben Wright has been cutting fence poles. Bliss is it on such a day to be alive; but to smell dying fir is very heaven. That&rsquo;s two thirds Wordsworth and one third Anne Shirley. It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible that there should be dying fir in heaven, does it? And yet it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that heaven would be quite perfect if you couldn&rsquo;t get a whiff of dead fir as you went through its woods. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll have the odor there without the death. Yes, I think that will be the way. That delicious aroma must be the souls of the firs . . . and of course it will be just souls in heaven.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
