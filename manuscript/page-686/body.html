<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Nothing has ever killed us yet; but Charlotta the Fourth has been known to have bad dreams after we had eaten doughnuts and mince pie and fruit cake before we went to bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Grandma lets me have a glass of milk and a slice of bread and butter before I go to bed; and on Sunday nights she puts jam on the bread,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m always glad when it&rsquo;s Sunday night . . . for more reasons than one. Sunday is a very long day on the shore road. Grandma says it&rsquo;s all too short for her and that father never found Sundays tiresome when he was a little boy. It wouldn&rsquo;t seem so long if I could talk to my rock people but I never do that because Grandma doesn&rsquo;t approve of it on Sundays. I think a good deal; but I&rsquo;m afraid my thoughts are worldly. Grandma says we should never think anything but religious thoughts on Sundays.</p></div> </div>
