<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I went out and carried Ginger to the barn. I can&rsquo;t say I enjoyed the meal. I knew by the look of Emily that there was trouble brewing for Ginger and James A. When the folks went away I started for the cow pasture and on the way I did some thinking. I felt sorry for Emily and kind of fancied I hadn&rsquo;t been so thoughtful of her as I might; and besides, I wondered if the ministers would think that Ginger had learned his vocabulary from me. The long and short of it was, I decided that Ginger would have to be mercifully disposed of and when I&rsquo;d druv the cows home I went in to tell Emily so. But there was no Emily and there was a letter on the table . . . just according to the rule in story books. Emily writ that I&rsquo;d have to choose between her and Ginger; she&rsquo;d gone back to her own house and there she would stay till I went and told her I&rsquo;d got rid of that parrot.</p></div> </div>
