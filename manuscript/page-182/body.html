<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Tuesday afternoon the Aid Society met at Green Gables. Anne hurried home from school, for she knew that Marilla would need all the assistance she could give. Dora, neat and proper, in her nicely starched white dress and black sash, was sitting with the members of the Aid in the parlor, speaking demurely when spoken to, keeping silence when not, and in every way comporting herself as a model child. Davy, blissfully dirty, was making mud pies in the barnyard.</p><p>&ldquo;I told him he might,&rdquo; said Marilla wearily. &ldquo;I thought it would keep him out of worse mischief. He can only get dirty at that. We&rsquo;ll have our teas over before we call him to his. Dora can have hers with us, but I would never dare to let Davy sit down at the table with all the Aids here.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
