It ran under patriarchal old firs whose branches met above, creating a perpetual gloom in which nothing except moss could grow. On either hand were brown wood floors, crossed here and there by fallen lances of sunlight. All was very still and remote, as if the world and the cares of the world were far away.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel as if we were walking through an enchanted forest,&rdquo; said Anne in a hushed tone. &ldquo;Do you suppose we&rsquo;ll ever find our way back to the real world again, Diana? We shall presently come to a palace with a spellbound princess in it, I think.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
