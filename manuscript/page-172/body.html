And Mrs. Wiggins never puts any plums in HER cakes. Catch her! Can I have another piece?&rdquo;</p><p>Marilla would have refused but Anne cut a generous second slice. However, she reminded Davy that he ought to say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; for it. Davy merely grinned at her and took a huge bite. When he had finished the slice he said,</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll give me ANOTHER piece I&rsquo;ll say thank you for IT.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
