<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Diana also took a very pessimistic view of affairs.</p><p>&ldquo;It will be horribly lonesome here next winter,&rdquo; she mourned, one twilight when the moonlight was raining &ldquo;airy silver&rdquo; through the cherry boughs and filling the east gable with a soft, dream-like radiance in which the two girls sat and talked, Anne on her low rocker by the window, Diana sitting Turkfashion on the bed. &ldquo;You and Gilbert will be gone . . . and the Allans too. They are going to call Mr. Allan to Charlottetown and of course he&rsquo;ll accept. It&rsquo;s too mean. We&rsquo;ll be vacant all winter, I suppose, and have to listen to a long string of candidates . . . and half of them won&rsquo;t be any good.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
