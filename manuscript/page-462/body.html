<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;And if the ache gets too bad you can come up to Green Gables and tell me your thoughts,&rdquo; suggested Anne, with all the gravity that endeared her to children, who so dearly love to be taken seriously.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I will. But I hope Davy won&rsquo;t be there when I go because he makes faces at me. I don&rsquo;t mind VERY much because he is such a little boy and I am quite a big one, but still it is not pleasant to have faces made at you. And Davy makes such terrible ones. Sometimes I am frightened he will never get his face straightened out again. He makes them at me in church when I ought to be thinking of sacred things. Dora likes me though, and I like her, but not so well as I did before she told Minnie May Barry that she meant to marry me when I grew up.</p></div> </div>
