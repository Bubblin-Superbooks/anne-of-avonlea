<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I tell you I thought at first I was in luck. Well, we were married and took a little wedding trip to St. John for a fortnight and then we went home. We got home at ten o&rsquo;clock at night, and I give you my word, Anne, that in half an hour that woman was at work housecleaning. Oh, I know you&rsquo;re thinking my house needed it . . . you&rsquo;ve got a very expressive face, Anne; your thoughts just come out on it like print . . . but it didn&rsquo;t, not that bad. It had got pretty mixed up while I was keeping bachelor&rsquo;s hall, I admit, but I&rsquo;d got a woman to come in and clean it up before I was married and there&rsquo;d been considerable painting and fixing done. I tell you if you took Emily into a brand new white marble palace she&rsquo;d be into the scrubbing as soon as she could get an old dress on.</p></div> </div>
