It wouldn&rsquo;t be nice to have something wrong in your upper story, would it, teacher? I suppose the reason Mary Joe imagines I have is because I tell her what I think about things sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is a rather dangerous practice,&rdquo; admitted Anne, out of the depths of her own experience.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, by and by I&rsquo;ll tell you the thoughts I told Mary Joe and you can see for yourself if there&rsquo;s anything queer in them,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll wait till it begins to get dark. That is the time I ache to tell people things, and when nobody else is handy I just HAVE to tell Mary Joe. But after this I won&rsquo;t, if it makes her imagine I&rsquo;m wrong in my upper story. I&rsquo;ll just ache and bear it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
