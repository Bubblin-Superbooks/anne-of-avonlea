But I&rsquo;d like Kerrenhappuch if it happened to be your name. I think people make their names nice or ugly just by what they are themselves. I can&rsquo;t bear Josie or Gertie for names now but before I knew the Pye girls I thought them real pretty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lovely idea, Diana,&rdquo; said Anne enthusiastically. &ldquo;Living so that you beautify your name, even if it wasn&rsquo;t beautiful to begin with . . . making it stand in people&rsquo;s thoughts for something so lovely and pleasant that they never think of it by itself. Thank you, Diana.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
