<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But people have sown their oats over again,&rdquo; said Anne comfortingly, &ldquo;and Mr. Harrison says he thinks if we have a good summer they will come out all right though late. And my annuals are all coming up again . . . but oh, nothing can replace the June lilies. Poor little Hester Gray will have none either. I went all the way back to her garden last night but there wasn&rsquo;t one. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll miss them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right for you to say such things, Anne, I really don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Marilla severely. &ldquo;Hester Gray has been dead for thirty years and her spirit is in heaven . . . I hope.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
