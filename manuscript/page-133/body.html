Nobody came but the door was open and we could hear somebody in the pantry, going on dreadfully. We couldn&rsquo;t make out the words but Diana says she knows they were swearing by the sound of them. I can&rsquo;t believe that of Mr. Blair, for he is always so quiet and meek; but at least he had great provocation, for Marilla, when that poor man came to the door, red as a beet, with perspiration streaming down his face, he had on one of his wife&rsquo;s big gingham aprons. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t get this durned thing off,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;for the strings are tied in a hard knot and I can&rsquo;t bust &lsquo;em, so you&rsquo;ll have to excuse me, ladies.&rsquo; We begged him not to mention it and went in and sat down.</p></div> </div>
