<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;That is why I chose it. Of course Gilbert and Fred would have taken this road if we had asked them. But you see, Diana, I feel myself responsible for the A.V.I.S., since I was the first to suggest it, and it seems to me that I ought to do the most disagreeable things. I&rsquo;m sorry on your account; but you needn&rsquo;t say a word at the cranky places. I&rsquo;ll do all the talking . . . Mrs. Lynde would say I was well able to. Mrs. Lynde doesn&rsquo;t know whether to approve of our enterprise or not. She inclines to, when she remembers that Mr. and Mrs. Allan are in favor of it; but the fact that village improvement societies first originated in the States is a count against it. So she is halting between two opinions and only success will justify us in Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s eyes.</p></div> </div>
