I do not think he chose his subject or added the postscript out of malice aforethought. It is just that he has not a great deal of tact or imagination.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Miss Shirley</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You told us to describe something strange we have seen. I will describe the Avonlea Hall. It has two doors, an inside one and an outside one. It has six windows and a chimney. It has two ends and two sides. It is painted blue. That is what makes it strange. It is built on the lower Carmody road. It is the third most important building in Avonlea. The others are the church and the blacksmith shop. They hold debating clubs and lectures in it and concerts.</p></div> </div>
