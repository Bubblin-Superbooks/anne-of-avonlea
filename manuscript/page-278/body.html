<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Anthony, was it you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it was,&rdquo; said Anthony insolently.</p><p>Anne took her pointer from her desk. It was a long, heavy hardwood pointer.</p><p>&ldquo;Come here, Anthony.&rdquo;</p><p>It was far from being the most severe punishment Anthony Pye had ever undergone. Anne, even the stormy-souled Anne she was at that moment, could not have punished any child cruelly. But the pointer nipped keenly and finally Anthony&rsquo;s bravado failed him; he winced and the tears came to his eyes.</p><p>Anne, conscience-stricken, dropped the pointer and told Anthony to go to his seat. She sat down at her desk feeling ashamed, repentant, and bitterly mortified. Her quick anger was gone and she would have given much to have been able to seek relief in tears. So all her boasts had come to this . . . she had actually whipped one of her pupils.</p></div> </div>
