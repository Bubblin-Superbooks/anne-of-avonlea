<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Everybody concerned in Miss Lavendar&rsquo;s story was very happy. Paul Irving rushed to Green Gables to talk the news over with Anne as soon as his father had told him.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew I could trust father to pick me out a nice little second mother,&rdquo; he said proudly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine thing to have a father you can depend on, teacher. I just love Miss Lavendar. Grandma is pleased, too. She says she&rsquo;s real glad father didn&rsquo;t pick out an American for his second wife, because, although it turned out all right the first time, such a thing wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to happen twice. Mrs. Lynde says she thoroughly approves of the match and thinks its likely Miss Lavendar will give up her queer notions and be like other people, now that she&rsquo;s going to be married. But I hope she won&rsquo;t give her queer notions up, teacher, because I like them.</p></div> </div>
