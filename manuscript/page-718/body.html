<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;So this is my little son&rsquo;s &lsquo;beautiful teacher,&rsquo; of whom I have heard so much,&rdquo; said Mr. Irving with a hearty handshake. &ldquo;Paul&rsquo;s letters have been so full of you, Miss Shirley, that I feel as if I were pretty well acquainted with you already. I want to thank you for what you have done for Paul. I think that your influence has been just what he needed. Mother is one of the best and dearest of women; but her robust, matter-of-fact Scotch common sense could not always understand a temperament like my laddie&rsquo;s. What was lacking in her you have supplied. Between you, I think Paul&rsquo;s training in these two past years has been as nearly ideal as a motherless boy&rsquo;s could be.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
