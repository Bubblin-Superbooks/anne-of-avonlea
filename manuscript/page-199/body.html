He was not disturbed in his task. The hall was situated on what was called &ldquo;the lower road.&rdquo; In late autumn this road was always muddy and wet, and people going to Carmody traveled by the longer &ldquo;upper&rdquo; road. The hall was so closely surrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it. Mr. Joshua Pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were so dear to his unsociable heart.</p></div> </div>
