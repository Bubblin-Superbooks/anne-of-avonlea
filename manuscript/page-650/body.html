But it&rsquo;s best to go, I think, and, as Marilla says, there&rsquo;s no good reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t. I must get out all my ambitions and dust them.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne sent in her resignation the next day; and Mrs. Rachel, after a heart to heart talk with Marilla, gratefully accepted the offer of a home at Green Gables.
