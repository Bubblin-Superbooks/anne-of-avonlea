She wore a gown of warm, rich red, and her head and shoulders were wrapped in a silvery gray silk shawl.</p><p>&ldquo;You look like the queen of the fir wood fairies,&rdquo; called Anne merrily.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you would come tonight, Anne,&rdquo; said Miss Lavendar, running forward. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m doubly glad, for Charlotta the Fourth is away. Her mother is sick and she had to go home for the night. I should have been very lonely if you hadn&rsquo;t come . . . even the dreams and the echoes wouldn&rsquo;t have been enough company. Oh, Anne, how pretty you are,&rdquo; she added suddenly, looking up at the tall, slim girl with the soft rose-flush of walking on her face.</p></div> </div>
