But I never could be. When I&rsquo;m forty-five I&rsquo;ll be horribly fat. And while there might be some romance about a thin old maid there couldn&rsquo;t possibly be any about a fat one. Oh, mind you, Nelson Atkins proposed to Ruby Gillis three weeks ago. Ruby told me all about it. She says she never had any intention of taking him, because any one who married him will have to go in with the old folks; but Ruby says that he made such a perfectly beautiful and romantic proposal that it simply swept her off her feet.</p></div> </div>
