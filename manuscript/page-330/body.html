<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>s an old man, &lsquo;cause maybe he&rsquo;ll like it better then. And he thinks it will be horrid to wear dresses and I think so too. Why can&rsquo;t men angels wear trousers, Anne? Chester Sloane is interested in those things, &lsquo;cause they&rsquo;re going to make a minister of him. He&rsquo;s got to be a minister &lsquo;cause his grandmother left the money to send him to college and he can&rsquo;t have it unless he is a minister. She thought a minister was such a &lsquo;spectable thing to have in a family. Chester says he doesn&rsquo;t mind much . . . though he&rsquo;d rather be a blacksmith . . . but he&rsquo;s bound to have all the fun he can before he begins to be a minister, &lsquo;cause he doesn&rsquo;t expect to have much afterwards. I ain&rsquo;t going to be a minister. I&rsquo;m going to be a storekeeper, like Mr. Blair, and keep heaps of candy and bananas.</p></div> </div>
