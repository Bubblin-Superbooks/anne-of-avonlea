I&rsquo;m going to give up trying to be good, &lsquo;cause no matter how good I am you&rsquo;d like Paul Irving better. So I might as well be bad and have the fun of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Paul Irving BETTER,&rdquo; said Anne seriously. &ldquo;I like you just as well, only in a different way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I want you to like me the same way,&rdquo; pouted Davy.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t like different people the same way.
