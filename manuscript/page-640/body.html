<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thomas Lynde faded out of life as quietly and unobtrusively as he had lived it. His wife was a tender, patient, unwearied nurse. Sometimes Rachel had been a little hard on her Thomas in health, when his slowness or meekness had provoked her; but when he became ill no voice could be lower, no hand more gently skillful, no vigil more uncomplaining.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a good wife to me, Rachel,&rdquo; he once said simply, when she was sitting by him in the dusk, holding his thin, blanched old hand in her work-hardened one. &ldquo;A good wife. I&rsquo;m sorry I ain&rsquo;t leaving you better off; but the children will look after you. They&rsquo;re all smart, capable children, just like their mother. A good mother . . . a good woman . . . .&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
