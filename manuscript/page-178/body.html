I don&rsquo;t see the good of being so awful clean. It&rsquo;s lots more comfable being dirty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Paul Irving washes his face every day of his own accord,&rdquo; said Anne astutely.</p><p>Davy had been an inmate of Green Gables for little over forty-eight hours; but he already worshipped Anne and hated Paul Irving, whom he had heard Anne praising enthusiastically the day after his arrival. If Paul Irving washed his face every day, that settled it. He, Davy Keith, would do it too, if it killed him. The same consideration induced him to submit meekly to the other details of his toilet, and he was really a handsome little lad when all was done. Anne felt an almost maternal pride in him as she led him into the old Cuthbert pew.</p></div> </div>
