I&rsquo;m getting used to it,&rdquo; he conceded. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I was sorry to see Emily. A man really needs some protection in a community like this, where he can&rsquo;t play a game of checkers with a neighbor without being accused of wanting to marry that neighbor&rsquo;s sister and having it put in the paper.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody would have supposed you went to see Isabella Andrews if you hadn&rsquo;t pretended to be unmarried,&rdquo; said Anne severely.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t pretend I was. If anybody&rsquo;d have asked me if I was married I&rsquo;d have said I was. But they just took it for granted. I wasn&rsquo;t anxious to talk about the matter . . . I was feeling too sore over it.</p></div> </div>
