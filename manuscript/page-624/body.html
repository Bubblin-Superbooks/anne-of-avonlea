<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As soon as they were comfortably seated on the veranda Mr. Harrison began his tale of woe.</p><p>&ldquo;I lived in Scottsford, New Brunswick, before I came here, Anne. My sister kept house for me and she suited me fine; she was just reasonably tidy and she let me alone and spoiled me . . . so Emily says. But three years ago she died. Before she died she worried a lot about what was to become of me and finally she got me to promise I&rsquo;d get married. She advised me to take Emily Scott because Emily had money of her own and was a pattern housekeeper. I said, says I, &lsquo;Emily Scott wouldn&rsquo;t look at me.&rsquo; &lsquo;You ask her and see,&rsquo; says my sister; and just to ease her mind I promised her I would . . . and I did. And Emily said she&rsquo;d have me. Never was so surprised in my life, Anne . . . a smart pretty little woman like her and an old fellow like me.</p></div> </div>
