It would be too mean,&rdquo; said Diana, who, however, was beginning to have uncomfortable misgivings on the subject.</p><p>&ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; said Marilla, coming out from the parlor, &ldquo;Miss Stacy wants to see Miss Barry&rsquo;s willowware platter.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne hastened to the sitting room closet to get the platter. She had, in accordance with her promise to Mrs. Lynde, written to Miss Barry of Charlottetown, asking for the loan of it. Miss Barry was an old friend of Anne&rsquo;s, and she promptly sent the platter out, with a letter exhorting Anne to be very careful of it, for she had paid twenty dollars for it. The platter had served its purpose at the Aid bazaar and had then been returned to the Green Gables closet, for Anne would not trust anybody but herself to take it back to town.</p></div> </div>
