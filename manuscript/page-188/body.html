The fire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while Marilla was busy in the pantry. Anne had her own troubles carrying that toad downstairs, for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she thought she had lost it in the hall. When she finally deposited it in the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief.</p><p>&ldquo;If Marilla knew she&rsquo;d never feel safe getting into bed again in her life. I&rsquo;m so glad that little sinner repented in time. There&rsquo;s Diana signaling to me from her window. I&rsquo;m glad . . . I really feel the need of some diversion, for what with Anthony Pye in school and Davy Keith at home my nerves have had about all they can endure for one day.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
