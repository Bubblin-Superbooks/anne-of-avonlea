<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Paul had talked so much to Anne about his mother and father that she felt as if she had known them. She thought his mother must have been very like what he was himself, in temperament and disposition; and she had an idea that Stephen Irving was a rather reserved man with a deep and tender nature which he kept hidden scrupulously from the world.</p><p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s not very easy to get acquainted with,&rdquo; Paul had said once. &ldquo;I never got really acquainted with him until after my little mother died. But he&rsquo;s splendid when you do get to know him. I love him the best in all the world, and Grandma Irving next, and then you, teacher. I&rsquo;d love you next to father if it wasn&rsquo;t my DUTY to love Grandma Irving best, because she&rsquo;s doing so much for me. YOU know, teacher. I wish she would leave the lamp in my room till I go to sleep, though.</p></div> </div>
