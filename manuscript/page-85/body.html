I don&rsquo;t believe in whipping children MUCH. I think, as you say, Anne, that there are better ways of managing as a rule, and that corporal punishment should be a last resort. But on the other hand, as Jane says, I believe there is an occasional child who can&rsquo;t be influenced in any other way and who, in short, needs a whipping and would be improved by it. Corporal punishment as a last resort is to be my rule.&rdquo;</p><p>Gilbert, having tried to please both sides, succeeded, as is usual and eminently right, in pleasing neither.
