<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> From out this soft glow and glamor shone a sweet, girlish face, with tender mother eyes, that was hanging on the wall at the foot of the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my little mother,&rdquo; said Paul with loving pride. &ldquo;I got Grandma to hang it there where I&rsquo;d see it as soon as I opened my eyes in the morning. I never mind not having the light when I go to bed now, because it just seems as if my little mother was right here with me. Father knew just what I would like for a birthday present, although he never asked me. Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful how much fathers DO know?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
