<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As they picked, Charlotta the Fourth confided to Anne her fears regarding Miss Lavendar. The warm-hearted little handmaiden was honestly worried over her adored mistress&rsquo; condition.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Lavendar isn&rsquo;t well, Miss Shirley, ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;m sure she isn&rsquo;t, though she never complains. She hasn&rsquo;t seemed like herself this long while, ma&rsquo;am . . . not since that day you and Paul were here together before. I feel sure she caught cold that night, ma&rsquo;am. After you and him had gone she went out and walked in the garden for long after dark with nothing but a little shawl on her. There was a lot of snow on the walks and I feel sure she got a chill, ma&rsquo;am. Ever since then I&rsquo;ve noticed her acting tired and lonesome like. She don&rsquo;t seem to take an interest in anything, ma&rsquo;am. She never pretends company&rsquo;s coming, nor fixes up for it, nor nothing, ma&rsquo;am.</p></div> </div>
