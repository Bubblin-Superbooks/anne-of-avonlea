YOU know, teacher.&rdquo;</p><p>Charlotta the Fourth was another radiant person.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Shirley, ma&rsquo;am, it has all turned out so beautiful. When Mr. Irving and Miss Lavendar come back from their tower I&rsquo;m to go up to Boston and live with them . . . and me only fifteen, and the other girls never went till they were sixteen. Ain&rsquo;t Mr. Irving splendid? He just worships the ground she treads on and it makes me feel so queer sometimes to see the look in his eyes when he&rsquo;s watching her. It beggars description, Miss Shirley, ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;m awful thankful they&rsquo;re so fond of each other. It&rsquo;s the best way, when all&rsquo;s said and done, though some folks can get along without it.</p></div> </div>
