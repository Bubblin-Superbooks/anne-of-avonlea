<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll amuse your Aunt Josephine with the &lsquo;strange eventful history&rsquo; of this afternoon when I go to town tomorrow. We&rsquo;ve had a rather trying time but it&rsquo;s over now. I&rsquo;ve got the platter, and that rain has laid the dust beautifully. So &lsquo;all&rsquo;s well that ends well.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not home yet,&rdquo; said Diana rather pessimistically, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s no telling what may happen before we are. You&rsquo;re such a girl to have adventures, Anne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Having adventures comes natural to some people,&rdquo; said Anne serenely. &ldquo;You just have a gift for them or you haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
