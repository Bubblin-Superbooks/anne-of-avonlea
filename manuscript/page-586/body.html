Milty Boulter said if it wasn&rsquo;t the moon&rsquo;s fault it must be grubs. But I only found one grub. He was a great big juicy curly grub. I put him on a stone and got another stone and smashed him flat. He made a jolly SQUISH I tell you. I was sorry there wasn&rsquo;t more of them. Dora&rsquo;s garden was planted same time&rsquo;s mine and her things are growing all right. It CAN&rsquo;T be the moon,&rdquo; Davy concluded in a reflective tone.</p></div> </div>
