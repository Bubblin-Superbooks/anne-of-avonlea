I didn&rsquo;t hurt her much . . . she just cried &lsquo;cause she&rsquo;s a girl. I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m a boy but I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m a twin. When Jimmy Sprott&rsquo;s sister conterdicks him he just says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m oldern you, so of course I know better,&rsquo; and that settles HER. But I can&rsquo;t tell Dora that, and she just goes on thinking diffrunt from me. You might let me drive the gee-gee for a spell, since I&rsquo;m a man.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
