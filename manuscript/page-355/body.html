<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;No, indeed, I wouldn&rsquo;t . . . that&rsquo;s just the way I feel. You&rsquo;re so good at understanding, teacher. Nobody else understands so well . . . not even grandma, although she&rsquo;s so good to me. Father understood pretty well, but still I couldn&rsquo;t talk much to him about mother, because it made him feel so bad. When he put his hand over his face I always knew it was time to stop. Poor father, he must be dreadfully lonesome without me; but you see he has nobody but a housekeeper now and he thinks housekeepers are no good to bring up little boys, especially when he has to be away from home so much on business. Grandmothers are better, next to mothers. Someday, when I&rsquo;m brought up, I&rsquo;ll go back to father and we&rsquo;re never going to be parted again.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
