She was a very pretty little person, evidently nearer fifty than forty, but with rosy cheeks, sparkling black eyes, and shining black hair, surmounted by a wonderful beflowered and beplumed bonnet. In spite of having driven eight miles over a dusty road she was as neat as if she had just stepped out of the proverbial bandbox.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this where Mr. James A. Harrison lives?&rdquo; she inquired briskly.</p><p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Harrison lives over there,&rdquo; said Anne, quite lost in astonishment.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I DID think this place seemed too tidy . . . MUCH too tidy for James A. to be living here, unless he has greatly changed since I knew him,&rdquo; chirped the little lady. &ldquo;Is it true that James A. is going to be married to some woman living in this settlement?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
