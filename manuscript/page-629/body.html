<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I&rsquo;d promised to put Ginger away in some safe place where nobody would hear him . . . Emily wouldn&rsquo;t touch his cage with a ten-foot pole . . . and I meant to do it, for I didn&rsquo;t want the ministers to hear anything unpleasant in my house. But it slipped my mind . . . Emily was worrying me so much about clean collars and grammar that it wasn&rsquo;t any wonder . . . and I never thought of that poor parrot till we sat down to tea. Just as minister number one was in the very middle of saying grace, Ginger, who was on the veranda outside the dining room window, lifted up HIS voice. The gobbler had come into view in the yard and the sight of a gobbler always had an unwholesome effect on Ginger. He surpassed himself that time. You can smile, Anne, and I don&rsquo;t deny I&rsquo;ve chuckled some over it since myself, but at the time I felt almost as much mortified as Emily.</p></div> </div>
