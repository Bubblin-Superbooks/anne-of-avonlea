<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It seems dreadful to be glad of anything in connection with a death,&rdquo; said Anne soberly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for poor Mr. Keith; but I AM glad that we can keep the twins.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very good thing about the money,&rdquo; said Marilla practically. &ldquo;I wanted to keep them but I really didn&rsquo;t see how I could afford to do it, especially when they grew older. The rent of the farm doesn&rsquo;t do any more than keep the house and I was bound that not a cent of your money should be spent on them. You do far too much for them as it is. Dora didn&rsquo;t need that new hat you bought her any more than a cat needs two tails. But now the way is made clear and they are provided for.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
