She always does, because she says I&rsquo;m too extravagant with them if company comes.&rdquo;</p><p>The girls were hungry enough to do justice to any fare, and they enjoyed Miss Sarah&rsquo;s excellent bread and butter and &ldquo;cowcumbers&rdquo; thoroughly.

It&rsquo;s a very old platter.&rdquo;</p><p>Diana gave Anne&rsquo;s foot a gentle kick under the table, meaning, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t agree&mdash;she&rsquo;ll let it go for twenty if you hold out.&rdquo; But Anne was not minded to take any chances in regard to that precious platter.
