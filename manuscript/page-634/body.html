<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I needn&rsquo;t tell it, for James A. is a just man and he would tell the truth. The blame was far from being all on his side. I can see that now. I wasn&rsquo;t back in my own house an hour before I wished I hadn&rsquo;t been so hasty but I wouldn&rsquo;t give in. I see now that I expected too much of a man. And I was real foolish to mind his bad grammar. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if a man does use bad grammar so long as he is a good provider and doesn&rsquo;t go poking round the pantry to see how much sugar you&rsquo;ve used in a week. I feel that James A. and I are going to be real happy now. I wish I knew who &lsquo;Observer&rsquo; is, so that I could thank him. I owe him a real debt of gratitude.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
