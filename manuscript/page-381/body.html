<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Davy, on the other hand, was rather heedless and forgetful; but he had the born knack of winning love, and even yet Anne and Marilla liked him the better.</p><p>While Dora proudly shelled the peas and Davy made boats of the pods, with masts of matches and sails of paper, Anne told Marilla about the wonderful contents of her letter.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Marilla, what do you think? I&rsquo;ve had a letter from Priscilla and she says that Mrs. Morgan is on the Island, and that if it is fine Thursday they are going to drive up to Avonlea and will reach here about twelve. They will spend the afternoon with us and go to the hotel at White Sands in the evening, because some of Mrs. Morgan&rsquo;s American friends are staying there. Oh, Marilla, isn&rsquo;t it wonderful? I can hardly believe I&rsquo;m not dreaming.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
