<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I DO sulk; and Stephen came back before I had finished sulking. I wouldn&rsquo;t listen to him and I wouldn&rsquo;t forgive him; and so he went away for good. He was too proud to come again. And then I sulked because he didn&rsquo;t come. I might have sent for him perhaps, but I couldn&rsquo;t humble myself to do that. I was just as proud as he was . . . pride and sulkiness make a very bad combination, Anne. But I could never care for anybody else and I didn&rsquo;t want to. I knew I would rather be an old maid for a thousand years than marry anybody who wasn&rsquo;t Stephen Irving. Well, it all seems like a dream now, of course. How sympathetic you look, Anne . . . as sympathetic as only seventeen can look. But don&rsquo;t overdo it. I&rsquo;m really a very happy, contented little person in spite of my broken heart.</p></div> </div>
