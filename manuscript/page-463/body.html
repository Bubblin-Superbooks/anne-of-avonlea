<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I may marry somebody when I grow up but I&rsquo;m far too young to be thinking of it yet, don&rsquo;t you think, teacher?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rather young,&rdquo; agreed teacher.</p><p>&ldquo;Speaking of marrying, reminds me of another thing that has been troubling me of late,&rdquo; continued Paul. &ldquo;Mrs. Lynde was down here one day last week having tea with Grandma, and Grandma made me show her my little mother&rsquo;s picture . . . the one father sent me for my birthday present. I didn&rsquo;t exactly want to show it to Mrs. Lynde. Mrs. Lynde is a good, kind woman, but she isn&rsquo;t the sort of person you want to show your mother&rsquo;s picture to. YOU know, teacher. But of course I obeyed Grandma. Mrs. Lynde said she was very pretty but kind of actressy looking, and must have been an awful lot younger than father.</p></div> </div>
