<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Davy had no sorrows that plum jam could not cure.</p><p>Sunday proved so rainy that there was no stirring abroad; but by Monday everybody had heard some version of the Harrison story. The school buzzed with it and Davy came home, full of information.</p><p>&ldquo;Marilla, Mr. Harrison has a new wife . . . well, not ezackly new, but they&rsquo;ve stopped being married for quite a spell, Milty says. I always s&rsquo;posed people had to keep on being married once they&rsquo;d begun, but Milty says no, there&rsquo;s ways of stopping if you can&rsquo;t agree. Milty says one way is just to start off and leave your wife, and that&rsquo;s what Mr. Harrison did. Milty says Mr. Harrison left his wife because she throwed things at him . . . HARD things . . . and Arty Sloane says it was because she wouldn&rsquo;t let him smoke, and Ned Clay says it was &lsquo;cause she never let up scolding him.</p></div> </div>
