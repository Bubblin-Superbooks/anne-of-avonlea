When a man don&rsquo;t know his own mind, Miss Shirley, ma&rsquo;am, how&rsquo;s a poor woman going to be sure of it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to the kitchen and clean the silver spoons,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a task which won&rsquo;t require much thinking fortunately . . . for I COULDN&rsquo;T think tonight.
