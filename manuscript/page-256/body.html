<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear teacher,</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You said we might write about a visit. I never visited but once. It was at my Aunt Mary&rsquo;s last winter. My Aunt Mary is a very particular woman and a great housekeeper. The first night I was there we were at tea. I knocked over a jug and broke it. Aunt Mary said she had had that jug ever since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before. When we got up I stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out of the skirt. The next morning when I got up I hit the pitcher against the basin and cracked them both and I upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth at breakfast. When I was helping Aunt Mary with the dinner dishes I dropped a china plate and it smashed. That evening I fell downstairs and sprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week. I heard Aunt Mary tell Uncle Joseph it was a mercy or I&rsquo;d have broken everything in the house.</p></div> </div>
