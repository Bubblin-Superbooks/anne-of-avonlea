<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One blithe June morning, a fortnight after Uncle Abe&rsquo;s storm, Anne came slowly through the Green Gables yard from the garden, carrying in her hands two blighted stalks of white narcissus.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, Marilla,&rdquo; she said sorrowfully, holding up the flowers before the eyes of a grim lady, with her hair coifed in a green gingham apron, who was going into the house with a plucked chicken, &ldquo;these are the only buds the storm spared . . . and even they are imperfect. I&rsquo;m so sorry . . . I wanted some for Matthew&rsquo;s grave. He was always so fond of June lilies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I kind of miss them myself,&rdquo; admitted Marilla, &ldquo;though it doesn&rsquo;t seem right to lament over them when so many worse things have happened. . . all the crops destroyed as well as the fruit.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
