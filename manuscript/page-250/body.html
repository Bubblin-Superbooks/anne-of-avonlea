<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think I will write you a letter to tell you how much I love you. I love you with my whole heart and soul and mind . . . with all there is of me to love . . . and I want to serve you for ever. It would be my highest privilege. That is why I try so hard to be good in school and learn my lessuns.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are so beautiful, my teacher. Your voice is like music and your eyes are like pansies when the dew is on them. You are like a tall stately queen. Your hair is like rippling gold. Anthony Pye says it is red, but you needn&rsquo;t pay any attention to Anthony.</p></div> </div>
