Paul never needed any coaxing to tell his thoughts . . . at least, to congenial souls.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought them out in the fir grove one night,&rdquo; he said dreamily. &ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t BELIEVE them but I THOUGHT them. YOU know, teacher. And then I wanted to tell them to somebody and there was nobody but Mary Joe. Mary Joe was in the pantry setting bread and I sat down on the bench beside her and I said, &lsquo;Mary Joe, do you know what I think? I think the evening star is a lighthouse on the land where the fairies dwell.&rsquo; And Mary Joe said, &lsquo;Well, yous are de queer one. Dare ain&rsquo;t no such ting as fairies.&rsquo; I was very much provoked. Of course, I knew there are no fairies; but that needn&rsquo;t prevent my thinking there is.</p></div> </div>
