<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How came Paul to fall into the brook at noon hour yesterday?&rdquo; asked Anne. &ldquo;I met him on the playground, such a dripping figure that I sent him promptly home for clothes without waiting to find out what had happened.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it was partly a zacksident,&rdquo; explained Davy. &ldquo;He stuck his head in on purpose but the rest of him fell in zacksidentally. We was all down at the brook and Prillie Rogerson got mad at Paul about something . . . she&rsquo;s awful mean and horrid anyway, if she IS pretty . . . and said that his grandmother put his hair up in curl rags every night. Paul wouldn&rsquo;t have minded what she said, I guess, but Gracie Andrews laughed, and Paul got awful red, &lsquo;cause Gracie&rsquo;s his girl, you know. He&rsquo;s CLEAN GONE on her . . . brings her flowers and carries her books as far as the shore road.</p></div> </div>
