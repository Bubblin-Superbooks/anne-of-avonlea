Mr. Jabez Sloane bought the farm and hauled the little house out to the road. Jordan died about ten years after and he was brought home and buried beside Hester.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand how she could have wanted to live back here, away from everything,&rdquo; said Jane.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I can easily understand THAT,&rdquo; said Anne thoughtfully. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want it myself for a steady thing, because, although I love the fields and woods, I love people too. But I can understand it in Hester. She was tired to death of the noise of the big city and the crowds of people always coming and going and caring nothing for her. She just wanted to escape from it all to some still, green, friendly place where she could rest.</p></div> </div>
