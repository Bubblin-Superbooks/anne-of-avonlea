<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My birthday is next week,&rdquo; said Paul, as they walked up the long red hill, basking in the June sunshine, &ldquo;and father wrote me that he is sending me something that he thinks I&rsquo;ll like better than anything else he could send. I believe it has come already, for Grandma is keeping the bookcase drawer locked and that is something new. And when I asked her why, she just looked mysterious and said little boys mustn&rsquo;t be too curious. It&rsquo;s very exciting to have a birthday, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ll be eleven. You&rsquo;d never think it to look at me, would you? Grandma says I&rsquo;m very small for my age and that it&rsquo;s all because I don&rsquo;t eat enough porridge. I do my very best, but Grandma gives such generous platefuls . . . there&rsquo;s nothing mean about Grandma, I can tell you.</p></div> </div>
