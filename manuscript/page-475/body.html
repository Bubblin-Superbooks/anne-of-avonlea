But I didn&rsquo;t know she was going to do that when I give it to her, so I WAS good, Anne.&rdquo;</p><p>In the twilight Anne sauntered down to the Dryad&rsquo;s Bubble and saw Gilbert Blythe coming down through the dusky Haunted Wood. She had a sudden realization that Gilbert was a schoolboy no longer. And how manly he looked&mdash;the tall, frank-faced fellow, with the clear, straightforward eyes and the broad shoulders. Anne thought Gilbert was a very handsome lad, even though he didn&rsquo;t look at all like her ideal man.
