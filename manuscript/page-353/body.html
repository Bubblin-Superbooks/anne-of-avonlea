He swung down and joined Anne, smiling; but there were traces of tears on his cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d wait for you, teacher, because I knew you were going to the graveyard,&rdquo; he said, slipping his hand into hers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going there, too . . . I&rsquo;m taking this bouquet of geraniums to put on Grandpa Irving&rsquo;s grave for grandma. And look, teacher, I&rsquo;m going to put this bunch of white roses beside Grandpa&rsquo;s grave in memory of my little mother. . . because I can&rsquo;t go to her grave to put it there.
