Anne crying . . . he had made Anne cry! A flood of real remorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it. He rushed to Anne, hurled himself into her lap, flung his arms around her neck, and burst into tears.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was wrong to tell whoppers,&rdquo; he sobbed. &ldquo;How did you expect me to know it was wrong? All Mr. Sprott&rsquo;s children told them REGULAR every day, and cross their hearts too. I s&rsquo;pose Paul Irving never tells whoppers and here I&rsquo;ve been trying awful hard to be as good as him, but now I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;ll never love me again. But I think you might have told me it was wrong.</p></div> </div>
