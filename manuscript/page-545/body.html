<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;So you had tea at the stone house with Lavendar Lewis?&rdquo; said Marilla at the breakfast table next morning. &ldquo;What is she like now? It&rsquo;s over fifteen years since I saw her last . . . it was one Sunday in Grafton church. I suppose she has changed a great deal. Davy Keith, when you want something you can&rsquo;t reach, ask to have it passed and don&rsquo;t spread yourself over the table in that fashion. Did you ever see Paul Irving doing that when he was here to meals?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But Paul&rsquo;s arms are longer&rsquo;n mine,&rdquo; brumbled Davy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had eleven years to grow and mine&rsquo;ve only had seven. &lsquo;Sides, I DID ask, but you and Anne was so busy talking you didn&rsquo;t pay any &lsquo;tention.</p></div> </div>
