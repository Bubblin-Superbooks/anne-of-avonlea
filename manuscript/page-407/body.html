Didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; whimpered Davy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told me not to do such an awful lot of things that I can&rsquo;t remember them all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you march upstairs and stay there till after dinner. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll get them sorted out in your memory by that time. No, Anne, never you mind interceding for him. I&rsquo;m not punishing him because he spoiled your pies . . . that was an accident. I&rsquo;m punishing him for his disobedience. Go, Davy, I say.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
