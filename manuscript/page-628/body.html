There&rsquo;s nothing I hate worse&rsquo;n profanity in a human being, but in a parrot, that&rsquo;s just repeating what it&rsquo;s heard with no more understanding of it than I&rsquo;d have of Chinese, allowances might be made. But Emily couldn&rsquo;t see it that way. Women ain&rsquo;t logical. She tried to break Ginger of swearing but she hadn&rsquo;t any better success than she had in trying to make me stop saying &lsquo;I seen&rsquo; and &lsquo;them things.&rsquo; Seemed as if the more she tried the worse Ginger got, same as me.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, things went on like this, both of us getting raspier, till the CLIMAX came. Emily invited our minister and his wife to tea, and another minister and HIS wife that was visiting them.</p></div> </div>
