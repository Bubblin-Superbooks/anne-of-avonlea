What are you frightened of?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of . . . of Mirabel Cotton&rsquo;s uncle,&rdquo; sobbed Dora. &ldquo;Mirabel Cotton told me all about her family today in school. Nearly everybody in her family has died . . . all her grandfathers and grandmothers and ever so many uncles and aunts. They have a habit of dying, Mirabel says. Mirabel&rsquo;s awful proud of having so many dead relations, and she told me what they all died of, and what they said, and how they looked in their coffins. And Mirabel says one of her uncles was seen walking around the house after he was buried.</p></div> </div>
