<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I think an old, deserted house is such a sad sight,&rdquo; said Anne dreamily. &ldquo;It always seems to me to be thinking about its past and mourning for its old-time joys. Marilla says that a large family was raised in that old house long ago, and that it was a real pretty place, with a lovely garden and roses climbing all over it. It was full of little children and laughter and songs; and now it is empty, and nothing ever wanders through it but the wind. How lonely and sorrowful it must feel! Perhaps they all come back on moonlit nights . . . the ghosts of the little children of long ago and the roses and the songs . . . and for a little while the old house can dream it is young and joyous again.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
