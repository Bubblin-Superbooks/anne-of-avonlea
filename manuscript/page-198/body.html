<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I must. I have some sewing to do for Dora this evening. Besides, Davy is probably breaking Marilla&rsquo;s heart with some new mischief by this time. This morning the first thing he said was, &lsquo;Where does the dark go, Anne? I want to know.&rsquo; I told him it went around to the other side of the world but after breakfast he declared it didn&rsquo;t . . . that it went down the well. Marilla says she caught him hanging over the well-box four times today, trying to reach down to the dark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a limb,&rdquo; declared Mr. Harrison. &ldquo;He came over here yesterday and pulled six feathers out of Ginger&rsquo;s tail before I could get in from the barn. The poor bird has been moping ever since. Those children must be a sight of trouble to you folks.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
