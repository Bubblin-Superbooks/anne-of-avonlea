<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mrs. Rachel Lynde came up the next Saturday and confirmed this.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Anne, I guess you&rsquo;ve won over Anthony Pye, that&rsquo;s what. He says he believes you are some good after all, even if you are a girl. Says that whipping you gave him was &lsquo;just as good as a man&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never expected to win him by whipping him, though,&rdquo; said Anne, a little mournfully, feeling that her ideals had played her false somewhere. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem right. I&rsquo;m sure my theory of kindness can&rsquo;t be wrong.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
