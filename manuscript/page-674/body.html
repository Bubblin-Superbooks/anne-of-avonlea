<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I would if I were driving. But I&rsquo;m going to walk and it&rsquo;s too far for your eight-year-old legs. Besides, Paul is going with me and I fear you don&rsquo;t enjoy yourself in his company.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I like Paul lots better&rsquo;n I did,&rdquo; said Davy, beginning to make fearful inroads into his pudding. &ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve got pretty good myself I don&rsquo;t mind his being gooder so much. If I can keep on I&rsquo;ll catch up with him some day, both in legs and goodness. &lsquo;Sides, Paul&rsquo;s real nice to us second primer boys in school. He won&rsquo;t let the other big boys meddle with us and he shows us lots of games.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
