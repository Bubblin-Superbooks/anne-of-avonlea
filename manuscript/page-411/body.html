We always do. Don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I put a spoonful in too, when I set them on the stove,&rdquo; said Diana.</p><p>Anne dropped her masher and tasted the peas also. Then she made a grimace.</p><p>&ldquo;How awful! I never dreamed you had put sugar in, because I knew your mother never does. I happened to think of it, for a wonder . . . I&rsquo;m always forgetting it . . . so I popped a spoonful in.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
