Someday when you get riled up . . . and people with hair like yours are desperate apt to get riled . . . you&rsquo;ll forget all your pretty little notions and give some of them a whaling. You&rsquo;re too young to be teaching anyhow . . . far too young and childish.&rdquo;</p><p>Altogether, Anne went to bed that night in a rather pessimistic mood. She slept poorly and was so pale and tragic at breakfast next morning that Marilla was alarmed and insisted on making her take a cup of scorching ginger tea.</p></div> </div>
