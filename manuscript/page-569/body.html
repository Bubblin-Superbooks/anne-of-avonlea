So commonplace that, if you&rsquo;ll believe me, I don&rsquo;t even remember just how it began. I hardly know who was the more to blame for it. Stephen did really begin it, but I suppose I provoked him by some foolishness of mine. He had a rival or two, you see. I was vain and coquettish and liked to tease him a little. He was a very high-strung, sensitive fellow. Well, we parted in a temper on both sides. But I thought it would all come right; and it would have if Stephen hadn&rsquo;t come back too soon. Anne, my dear, I&rsquo;m sorry to say&rdquo; . . . Miss Lavendar dropped her voice as if she were about to confess a predilection for murdering people, &ldquo;that I am a dreadfully sulky person. Oh, you needn&rsquo;t smile, . . . it&rsquo;s only too true.</p></div> </div>
