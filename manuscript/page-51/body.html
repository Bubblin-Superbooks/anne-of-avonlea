I don&rsquo;t see how she got out of the pen, though. She must have broken some of the boards off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of looking,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll go and see now. Martin has never come back yet. Perhaps some more of his aunts have died. I think it&rsquo;s something like Mr. Peter Sloane and the octogenarians. The other evening Mrs. Sloane was reading a newspaper and she said to Mr. Sloane, &lsquo;I see here that another octogenarian has just died. What is an octogenarian, Peter?&rsquo; And Mr. Sloane said he didn&rsquo;t know, but they must be very sickly creatures, for you never heard tell of them but they were dying. That&rsquo;s the way with Martin&rsquo;s aunts.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
