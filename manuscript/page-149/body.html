<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I haven&rsquo;t a great many spare moments, you know. By the time I finish correcting school exercises and compositions, I don&rsquo;t always feel like writing any of my own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are getting on splendidly in school, Anne. All the children like you,&rdquo; said Gilbert, sitting down on the stone step.</p><p>&ldquo;No, not all. Anthony Pye doesn&rsquo;t and WON&rsquo;T like me. What is worse, he doesn&rsquo;t respect me . . . no, he doesn&rsquo;t. He simply holds me in contempt and I don&rsquo;t mind confessing to you that it worries me miserably. It isn&rsquo;t that he is so very bad . . . he is only rather mischievous, but no worse than some of the others. He seldom disobeys me; but he obeys with a scornful air of toleration as if it wasn&rsquo;t worthwhile disputing the point or he would . . . and it has a bad effect on the others.</p></div> </div>
