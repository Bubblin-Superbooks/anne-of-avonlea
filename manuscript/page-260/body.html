<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There are a great many people who do not understand things so there is no use in telling them.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My rock people live at the shore. I used to visit them almost every evening before the winter came. Now I can&rsquo;t go till spring, but they will be there, for people like that never change . . . that is the splendid thing about them. Nora was the first one of them I got acquainted with and so I think I love her the best. She lives in Andrews&rsquo; Cove and she has black hair and black eyes, and she knows all about the mermaids and the water kelpies. You ought to hear the stories she can tell. Then there are the Twin Sailors. They don&rsquo;t live anywhere, they sail all the time, but they often come ashore to talk to me. They are a pair of jolly tars and they have seen everything in the world. . . and more than what is in the world.</p></div> </div>
