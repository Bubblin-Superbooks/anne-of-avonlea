<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come from the ends of the earth if necessary,&rdquo; promised Anne solemnly.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, it won&rsquo;t be for ever so long yet,&rdquo; said Diana, blushing. &ldquo;Three years at the very least . . . for I&rsquo;m only eighteen and mother says no daughter of hers shall be married before she&rsquo;s twenty-one. Besides, Fred&rsquo;s father is going to buy the Abraham Fletcher farm for him and he says he&rsquo;s got to have it two thirds paid for before he&rsquo;ll give it to him in his own name. But three years isn&rsquo;t any too much time to get ready for housekeeping, for I haven&rsquo;t a speck of fancy work made yet. But I&rsquo;m going to begin crocheting doilies tomorrow. Myra Gillis had thirty-seven doilies when she was married and I&rsquo;m determined I shall have as many as she had.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
