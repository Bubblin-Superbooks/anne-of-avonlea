<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Anne had at last discovered a real &ldquo;kindred spirit,&rdquo; while into the little lady&rsquo;s lonely, sequestered life of dreams Anne and Diana came with the wholesome joy and exhilaration of the outer existence, which Miss Lavendar, &ldquo;the world forgetting, by the world forgot,&rdquo; had long ceased to share; they brought an atmosphere of youth and reality to the little stone house. Charlotta the Fourth always greeted them with her very widest smile . . . and Charlotta&rsquo;s smiles WERE fearfully wide . . . loving them for the sake of her adored mistress as well as for their own.
