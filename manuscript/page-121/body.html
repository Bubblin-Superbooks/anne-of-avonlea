<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Priscilla is going to write a paper for our next Improvement meeting, and I expect it will be good, for her aunt is such a clever writer and no doubt it runs in the family. I shall never forget the thrill it gave me when I found out that Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan was Priscilla&rsquo;s aunt. It seemed so wonderful that I was a friend of the girl whose aunt wrote &lsquo;Edgewood Days&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Rosebud Garden.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where does Mrs. Morgan live?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In Toronto. And Priscilla says she is coming to the Island for a visit next summer, and if it is possible Priscilla is going to arrange to have us meet her. That seems almost too good to be true&mdash;but it&rsquo;s something pleasant to imagine after you go to bed.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
