<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t their uncle been heard from?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Mary had a letter from him. He&rsquo;s working in a lumber camp and &lsquo;shacking it,&rsquo; whatever that means. Anyway, he says he can&rsquo;t possibly take the children till the spring. He expects to be married then and will have a home to take them to; but he says she must get some of the neighbors to keep them for the winter. She says she can&rsquo;t bear to ask any of them. Mary never got on any too well with the East Grafton people and that&rsquo;s a fact. And the long and short of it is, Anne, that I&rsquo;m sure Mary wants me to take those children . . . she didn&rsquo;t say so but she LOOKED it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
