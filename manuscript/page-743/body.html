<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I&rsquo;ve got an aunt who has been married three times and says she married the first time for love and the last two times for strictly business, and was happy with all three except at the times of the funerals. But I think she took a resk, Miss Shirley, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all so romantic,&rdquo; breathed Anne to Marilla that night. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t taken the wrong path that day we went to Mr. Kimball&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d never have known Miss Lavendar; and if I hadn&rsquo;t met her I&rsquo;d never have taken Paul there . . . and he&rsquo;d never have written to his father about visiting Miss Lavendar just as Mr. Irving was starting for San Francisco. Mr. Irving says whenever he got that letter he made up his mind to send his partner to San Francisco and come here instead.</p></div> </div>
