But I don&rsquo;t think St. Clair minds. It was because Jimmy called him &lsquo;St. Clair&rsquo; that St. Clair pounded him on the way home from school. I heard of the pounding, but not officially, so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll take any notice of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Yesterday I was trying to teach Lottie Wright to do addition. I said, &lsquo;If you had three candies in one hand and two in the other, how many would you have altogether?&rsquo; &lsquo;A mouthful,&rsquo; said Lottie. And in the nature study class, when I asked them to give me a good reason why toads shouldn&rsquo;t be killed, Benjie Sloane gravely answered, &lsquo;Because it would rain the next day.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
