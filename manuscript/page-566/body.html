<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re here, Anne,&rdquo; said Miss Lavendar, nibbling at her candy. &ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t I should be blue . . . very blue . . . almost navy blue. Dreams and make-believes are all very well in the daytime and the sunshine, but when dark and storm come they fail to satisfy. One wants real things then. But you don&rsquo;t know this . . . seventeen never knows it. At seventeen dreams DO satisfy because you think the realities are waiting for you further on. When I was seventeen, Anne, I didn&rsquo;t think forty-five would find me a white-haired little old maid with nothing but dreams to fill my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you aren&rsquo;t an old maid,&rdquo; said Anne, smiling into Miss Lavendar&rsquo;s wistful woodbrown eyes. &ldquo;Old maids are BORN . . . they don&rsquo;t BECOME.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
