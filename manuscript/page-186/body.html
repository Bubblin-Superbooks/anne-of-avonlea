<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Anne, don&rsquo;t you like me a little bit, even if I ain&rsquo;t a good boy like Paul?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed I do,&rdquo; said Anne sincerely. Somehow, it was impossible to help liking Davy. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like you better still if you weren&rsquo;t so naughty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I . . . did something else today,&rdquo; went on Davy in a muffled voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry now but I&rsquo;m awful scared to tell you. You won&rsquo;t be very cross, will you? And you won&rsquo;t tell Marilla, will you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Davy. Perhaps I ought to tell her. But I think I can promise you I won&rsquo;t if you promise me that you will never do it again, whatever it is.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
