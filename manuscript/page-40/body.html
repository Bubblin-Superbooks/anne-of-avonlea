<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne drove over to Carmody on a shopping expedition the next afternoon and took Diana Barry with her. Diana was, of course, a pledged member of the Improvement Society, and the two girls talked about little else all the way to Carmody and back.</p><p>&ldquo;The very first thing we ought to do when we get started is to have that hall painted,&rdquo; said Diana, as they drove past the Avonlea hall, a rather shabby building set down in a wooded hollow, with spruce trees hooding it about on all sides. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a disgraceful looking place and we must attend to it even before we try to get Mr. Levi Boulder to pull his house down. Father says we&rsquo;ll never succeed in DOING that. Levi Boulter is too mean to spend the time it would take.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
