<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne, walking home from the post office one Friday evening, was joined by Mrs. Lynde, who was as usual cumbered with all the cares of church and state.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been down to Timothy Cotton&rsquo;s to see if I could get Alice Louise to help me for a few days,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had her last week, for, though she&rsquo;s too slow to stop quick, she&rsquo;s better than nobody. But she&rsquo;s sick and can&rsquo;t come. Timothy&rsquo;s sitting there, too, coughing and complaining. He&rsquo;s been dying for ten years and he&rsquo;ll go on dying for ten years more. That kind can&rsquo;t even die and have done with it . . . they can&rsquo;t stick to anything, even to being sick, long enough to finish it. They&rsquo;re a terrible shiftless family and what is to become of them I don&rsquo;t know, but perhaps Providence does.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
