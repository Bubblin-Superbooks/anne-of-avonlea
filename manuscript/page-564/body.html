<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;How pretty and how young! It&rsquo;s so delightful to be seventeen, isn&rsquo;t it? I do envy you,&rdquo; concluded Miss Lavendar candidly.</p><p>&ldquo;But you are only seventeen at heart,&rdquo; smiled Anne.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m old . . . or rather middle-aged, which is far worse,&rdquo; sighed Miss Lavendar. &ldquo;Sometimes I can pretend I&rsquo;m not, but at other times I realize it. And I can&rsquo;t reconcile myself to it as most women seem to. I&rsquo;m just as rebellious as I was when I discovered my first gray hair. Now, Anne, don&rsquo;t look as if you were trying to understand. Seventeen CAN&rsquo;T understand. I&rsquo;m going to pretend right away that I am seventeen too, and I can do it, now that you&rsquo;re here. You always bring youth in your hand like a gift. We&rsquo;re going to have a jolly evening. Tea first . . .</p></div> </div>
