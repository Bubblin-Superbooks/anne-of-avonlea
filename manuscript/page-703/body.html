<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, have you really? How old is he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About your age I think. He ought to be older because I dreamed him long before you were born. But I&rsquo;ll never let him get any older than eleven or twelve; because if I did some day he might grow up altogether and then I&rsquo;d lose him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; nodded Paul. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the beauty of dream-people . . . they stay any age you want them. You and my beautiful teacher and me myself are the only folks in the world that I know of that have dream-people. Isn&rsquo;t it funny and nice we should all know each other? But I guess that kind of people always find each other out. Grandma never has dream-people and Mary Joe thinks I&rsquo;m wrong in the upper story because I have them. But I think it&rsquo;s splendid to have them. YOU know, Miss Lavendar. Tell me all about your little dream-boy.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
