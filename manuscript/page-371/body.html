<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;True friendship is a very helpful thing indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Allan, &ldquo;and we should have a very high ideal of it, and never sully it by any failure in truth and sincerity. I fear the name of friendship is often degraded to a kind of intimacy that has nothing of real friendship in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes . . . like Gertie Pye&rsquo;s and Julia Bell&rsquo;s. They are very intimate and go everywhere together; but Gertie is always saying nasty things of Julia behind her back and everybody thinks she is jealous of her because she is always so pleased when anybody criticizes Julia. I think it is desecration to call that friendship. If we have friends we should look only for the best in them and give them the best that is in us, don&rsquo;t you think? Then friendship would be the most beautiful thing in the world.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
