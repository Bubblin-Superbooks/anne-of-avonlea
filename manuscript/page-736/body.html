There&rsquo;ll be a wedding in this old stone house before the maple leaves are red. Do you want that translated into prose, Charlotta?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I can understand that,&rdquo; said Charlotta. &ldquo;A wedding ain&rsquo;t poetry. Why, Miss Shirley, ma&rsquo;am, you&rsquo;re crying! What for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, because it&rsquo;s all so beautiful . . . and story bookish . . . and romantic . . . and sad,&rdquo; said Anne, winking the tears out of her eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all perfectly lovely . . . but there&rsquo;s a little sadness mixed up in it too, somehow.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
