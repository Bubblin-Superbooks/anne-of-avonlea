<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Dora&rsquo;s nose was straight, Davy&rsquo;s a positive snub; Dora had a &ldquo;prunes and prisms&rdquo; mouth, Davy&rsquo;s was all smiles; and besides, he had a dimple in one cheek and none in the other, which gave him a dear, comical, lopsided look when he laughed. Mirth and mischief lurked in every corner of his little face.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d better go to bed,&rdquo; said Marilla, who thought it was the easiest way to dispose of them. &ldquo;Dora will sleep with me and you can put Davy in the west gable. You&rsquo;re not afraid to sleep alone, are you, Davy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No; but I ain&rsquo;t going to bed for ever so long yet,&rdquo; said Davy comfortably.</p></div> </div>
