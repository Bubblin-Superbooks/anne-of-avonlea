But he meant to keep himself worthy of Anne&rsquo;s friendship and perhaps some distant day her love; and he watched over word and thought and deed as jealously as if her clear eyes were to pass in judgment on it. She held over him the unconscious influence that every girl, whose ideals are high and pure, wields over her friends; an influence which would endure as long as she was faithful to those ideals and which she would as certainly lose if she were ever false to them. In Gilbert&rsquo;s eyes Anne&rsquo;s greatest charm was the fact that she never stooped to the petty practices of so many of the Avonlea girls&mdash;the small jealousies, the little deceits and rivalries, the palpable bids for favor.</p></div> </div>
