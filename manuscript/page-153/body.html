<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed Anne, &ldquo;but it was really a difficult task. At first, when I called him &lsquo;St. Clair&rsquo; he would not take the least notice until I&rsquo;d spoken two or three times; and then, when the other boys nudged him, he would look up with such an aggrieved air, as if I&rsquo;d called him John or Charlie and he couldn&rsquo;t be expected to know I meant him. So I kept him in after school one night and talked kindly to him. I told him his mother wished me to call him St. Clair and I couldn&rsquo;t go against her wishes. He saw it when it was all explained out . . . he&rsquo;s really a very reasonable little fellow . . . and he said I could call him St. Clair but that he&rsquo;d &lsquo;lick the stuffing&rsquo; out of any of the boys that tried it. Of course, I had to rebuke him again for using such shocking language.</p></div> </div>
