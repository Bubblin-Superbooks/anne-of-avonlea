One Friday evening Diana came over.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d a letter from Ella Kimball today, Anne, and she wants us to go over to tea tomorrow afternoon to meet her cousin, Irene Trent, from town. But we can&rsquo;t get one of our horses to go, for they&rsquo;ll all be in use tomorrow, and your pony is lame . . . so I suppose we can&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we walk?&rdquo; suggested Anne. &ldquo;If we go straight back through the woods we&rsquo;ll strike the West Grafton road not far from the Kimball place. I was through that way last winter and I know the road. It&rsquo;s no more than four miles and we won&rsquo;t have to walk home, for Oliver Kimball will be sure to drive us.</p></div> </div>
