<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give you girls a bunch of lavendar apiece,&rdquo; said Miss Lavendar brightly, as if she had not heard the answer to her question. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very sweet, don&rsquo;t you think? Mother always loved it. She planted these borders long ago. Father named me Lavendar because he was so fond of it. The very first time he saw mother was when he visited her home in East Grafton with her brother. He fell in love with her at first sight; and they put him in the spare room bed to sleep and the sheets were scented with lavendar and he lay awake all night and thought of her. He always loved the scent of lavendar after that . . . and that was why he gave me the name. Don&rsquo;t forget to come back soon, girls dear. We&rsquo;ll be looking for you, Charlotta the Fourth and I.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
