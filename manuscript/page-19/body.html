Bless my soul, this is the third time, miss . . . the third time! Patience has ceased to be a virtue, miss. I warned your aunt the last time not to let it occur again . . . and she&rsquo;s let it . . . she&rsquo;s done it . . . what does she mean by it, that is what I want to know. That is what I&rsquo;m here about, miss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you explain what the trouble is?&rdquo; asked Anne, in her most dignified manner.
