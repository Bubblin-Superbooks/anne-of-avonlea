But put it out of your mind, there&rsquo;s a dear. It will keep till Monday . . . or if it doesn&rsquo;t so much the better. Oh, girls, girls, see that patch of violets! There&rsquo;s something for memory&rsquo;s picture gallery. When I&rsquo;m eighty years old . . . if I ever am . . . I shall shut my eyes and see those violets just as I see them now. That&rsquo;s the first good gift our day has given us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If a kiss could be seen I think it would look like a violet,&rdquo; said Priscilla.</p></div> </div>
