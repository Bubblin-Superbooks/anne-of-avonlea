<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t father,&rsquo; sobbed Annetta, &lsquo;it was someone who was studying for a minister, and so he could write lovely letters, but ma didn&rsquo;t marry him after all. She said she couldn&rsquo;t make out what he was driving at half the time. But I thought the letters were sweet and that I&rsquo;d just copy things out of them here and there to write you. I put &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; where he put &ldquo;lady&rdquo; and I put in something of my own when I could think of it and I changed some words. I put &ldquo;dress&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;mood.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know just what a &ldquo;mood&rdquo; was but I s&rsquo;posed it was something to wear. I didn&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;d know the difference. I don&rsquo;t see how you found out it wasn&rsquo;t all mine. You must be awful clever, teacher.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
