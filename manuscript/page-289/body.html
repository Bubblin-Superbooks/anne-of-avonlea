<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Anne, on her way to Orchard Slope, met Diana, bound for Green Gables, just where the mossy old log bridge spanned the brook below the Haunted Wood, and they sat down by the margin of the Dryad&rsquo;s Bubble, where tiny ferns were unrolling like curly-headed green pixy folk wakening up from a nap.</p><p>&ldquo;I was just on my way over to invite you to help me celebrate my birthday on Saturday,&rdquo; said Anne.</p><p>&ldquo;Your birthday? But your birthday was in March!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t my fault,&rdquo; laughed Anne. &ldquo;If my parents had consulted me it would never have happened then. I should have chosen to be born in spring, of course. It must be delightful to come into the world with the mayflowers and violets. You would always feel that you were their foster sister.</p></div> </div>
