That makes a difference,&rdquo; said Miss Lavendar, exchanging amused glances with Anne over Paul&rsquo;s brown curls. &ldquo;I suppose that snacks ARE extremely unwholesome. That is why we have them so often at Echo Lodge. We. . . Charlotta the Fourth and I . . . live in defiance of every known law of diet. We eat all sorts of indigestible things whenever we happen to think of it, by day or night; and we flourish like green bay trees. We are always intending to reform. When we read any article in a paper warning us against something we like we cut it out and pin it up on the kitchen wall so that we&rsquo;ll remember it. But we never can somehow . . . until after we&rsquo;ve gone and eaten that very thing.</p></div> </div>
