<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Milty&rsquo;s a great hand at esplaining things. Even if he don&rsquo;t know anything about a thing he&rsquo;ll make up a lot of stuff and so you get it esplained all the same. His mother is Mrs. Simon&rsquo;s sister and he went with her to the funeral when his cousin, Jane Ellen, died. The minister said she&rsquo;d gone to heaven, though Milty says she was lying right before them in the coffin. But he s&rsquo;posed they carried the coffin to the garret afterwards. Well, when Milty and his mother went upstairs after it was all over to get her bonnet he asked her where heaven was that Jane Ellen had gone to, and she pointed right to the ceiling and said, &lsquo;Up there.&rsquo; Milty knew there wasn&rsquo;t anything but the garret over the ceiling, so that&rsquo;s how HE found out. And he&rsquo;s been awful scared to go to his Uncle Simon&rsquo;s ever since.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
