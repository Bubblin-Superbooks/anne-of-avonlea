<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Eliza was sewing patchwork, not because it was needed but simply as a protest against the frivolous lace Catherine was crocheting. Eliza listened with a frown and Catherine with a smile, as the girls explained their errand. To be sure, whenever Catherine caught Eliza&rsquo;s eye she discarded the smile in guilty confusion; but it crept back the next moment.</p><p>&ldquo;If I had money to waste,&rdquo; said Eliza grimly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d burn it up and have the fun of seeing a blaze maybe; but I wouldn&rsquo;t give it to that hall, not a cent. It&rsquo;s no benefit to the settlement . . . just a place for young folks to meet and carry on when they&rsquo;s better be home in their beds.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
