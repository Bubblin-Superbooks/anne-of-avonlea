<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Well, she cleaned house till one o&rsquo;clock that night and at four she was up and at it again. And she kept on that way . . . far&rsquo;s I could see she never stopped. It was scour and sweep and dust everlasting, except on Sundays, and then she was just longing for Monday to begin again. But it was her way of amusing herself and I could have reconciled myself to it if she&rsquo;d left me alone. But that she wouldn&rsquo;t do. She&rsquo;d set out to make me over but she hadn&rsquo;t caught me young enough. I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to come into the house unless I changed my boots for slippers at the door. I darsn&rsquo;t smoke a pipe for my life unless I went to the barn. And I didn&rsquo;t use good enough grammar. Emily&rsquo;d been a schoolteacher in her early life and she&rsquo;d never got over it. Then she hated to see me eating with my knife. Well, there it was, pick and nag everlasting.</p></div> </div>
