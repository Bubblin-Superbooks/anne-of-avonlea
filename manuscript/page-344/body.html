<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Two men were sitting in their buggies, reined off to the side of the road, just at the entrance of the path. One was Judson Parker; the other was Jerry Corcoran, a Newbridge man against whom, as Mrs. Lynde would have told you in eloquent italics, nothing shady had ever been PROVED. He was an agent for agricultural implements and a prominent personage in matters political. He had a finger . . . some people said ALL his fingers . . . in every political pie that was cooked; and as Canada was on the eve of a general election Jerry Corcoran had been a busy man for many weeks, canvassing the county in the interests of his party&rsquo;s candidate. Just as Anne emerged from under the overhanging beech boughs she heard Corcoran say, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll vote for Amesbury, Parker . . . well, I&rsquo;ve a note for that pair of harrows you&rsquo;ve got in the spring. I suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t object to having it back, eh?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
