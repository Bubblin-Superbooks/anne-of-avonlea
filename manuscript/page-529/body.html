I&rsquo;m not expecting anybody . . . I was just pretending I was. You see, I was so lonely. I love company . . . that is, the right kind of company.. .but so few people ever come here because it is so far out of the way. Charlotta the Fourth was lonely too. So I just pretended I was going to have a tea party. I cooked for it . . . and decorated the table for it.. . and set it with my mother&rsquo;s wedding china . . . and I dressed up for it.&rdquo; Diana secretly thought Miss Lavendar quite as peculiar as report had pictured her.</p></div> </div>
