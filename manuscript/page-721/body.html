But Anne felt that he was thinking of something else underneath all the time.

Do you know her well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, she is a very dear friend of mine,&rdquo; was Anne&rsquo;s demure reply, which gave no hint of the sudden thrill that tingled over her from head to foot at Mr. Irving&rsquo;s question. Anne &ldquo;felt instinctively&rdquo; that romance was peeping at her around a corner.</p></div> </div>
