I like to fancy souls as being made of light. And some are all shot through with rosy stains and quivers . . . and some have a soft glitter like moonlight on the sea . . . and some are pale and transparent like mist at dawn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I read somewhere once that souls were like flowers,&rdquo; said Priscilla.</p><p>&ldquo;Then your soul is a golden narcissus,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;and Diana&rsquo;s is like a red, red rose. Jane&rsquo;s is an apple blossom, pink and wholesome and sweet.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
