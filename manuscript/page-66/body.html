<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Bless my soul,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Harrison, in blank amazement at this unlooked-for conclusion. &ldquo;What a VERY extraordinary thing!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t in the least extraordinary that I should be getting myself and other people into scrapes,&rdquo; said Anne mournfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m noted for that. You might suppose I&rsquo;d have grown out of it by this time . . . I&rsquo;ll be seventeen next March . . . but it seems that I haven&rsquo;t. Mr. Harrison, is it too much to hope that you&rsquo;ll forgive me? I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s too late to get your cow back, but here is the money for her . . . or you can have mine in exchange if you&rsquo;d rather. She&rsquo;s a very good cow. And I can&rsquo;t express how sorry I am for it all.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
