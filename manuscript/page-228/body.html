<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;whopper,&rsquo; Davy . . . say &lsquo;falsehood,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the schoolma&rsquo;am.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; queried Davy, settling comfortably down and looking up with a tearstained, investigating face. &ldquo;Why ain&rsquo;t whopper as good as falsehood? I want to know. It&rsquo;s just as big a word.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s slang; and it&rsquo;s wrong for little boys to use slang.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an awful lot of things it&rsquo;s wrong to do,&rdquo; said Davy with a sigh. &ldquo;I never s&rsquo;posed there was so many. I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s wrong to tell whop . . . falsehoods, &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s awful handy, but since it is I&rsquo;m never going to tell any more. What are you going to do to me for telling them this time? I want to know.&rdquo; Anne looked beseechingly at Marilla.</p></div> </div>
