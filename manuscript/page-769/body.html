<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Below the window Miss Lavendar&rsquo;s garden, which should have been a glory of pale virgin sunshine, lay dim and windless; and the sky over the firs was dark with moody clouds.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it too mean!&rdquo; said Diana.</p><p>&ldquo;We must hope for the best,&rdquo; said Anne determinedly. &ldquo;If it only doesn&rsquo;t actually rain, a cool, pearly gray day like this would really be nicer than hot sunshine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it will rain,&rdquo; mourned Charlotta, creeping into the room, a figure of fun, with her many braids wound about her head, the ends, tied up with white thread, sticking out in all directions. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll hold off till the last minute and then pour cats and dogs. And all the folks will get sopping . . . and track mud all over the house . . . and they won&rsquo;t be able to be married under the honeysuckle . . .</p></div> </div>
