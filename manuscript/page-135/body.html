Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a small layer cake?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I felt sorrier than ever for the poor man. He didn&rsquo;t seem to be in his proper sphere at all. I had heard of henpecked husbands and now I felt that I saw one. It was on my lips to say, &lsquo;Mr. Blair, if you&rsquo;ll give us a subscription for the hall I&rsquo;ll mix up your cake for you.&rsquo; But I suddenly thought it wouldn&rsquo;t be neighborly to drive too sharp a bargain with a fellow creature in distress. So I offered to mix the cake for him without any conditions at all. He just jumped at my offer. He said he&rsquo;d been used to making his own bread before he was married but he feared cake was beyond him, and yet he hated to disappoint his wife.</p></div> </div>
