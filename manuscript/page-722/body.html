For a few moments there was silence in the little dark-walled room. Then he turned and looked down into Anne&rsquo;s sympathetic face with a smile, half-whimsical, half-tender.</p><p>&ldquo;I wonder how much you know,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;I know all about it,&rdquo; replied Anne promptly. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she explained hastily, &ldquo;Miss Lavendar and I are very intimate. She wouldn&rsquo;t tell things of such a sacred nature to everybody. We are kindred spirits.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe you are. Well, I am going to ask a favor of you. I would like to go and see Miss Lavendar if she will let me. Will you ask her if I may come?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
