It was that night you were at the Carmody concert and I was putting him to bed. He said he didn&rsquo;t see the good of praying until he got big enough to be of some importance to God. Anne, I do not know what we are going to do with that child. I never saw his beat. I&rsquo;m feeling clean discouraged.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that, Marilla. Remember how bad I was when I came here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anne, you never were bad . . . NEVER. I see that now, when I&rsquo;ve learned what real badness is. You were always getting into terrible scrapes, I&rsquo;ll admit, but your motive was always good. Davy is just bad from sheer love of it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
