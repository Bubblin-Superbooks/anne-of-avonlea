<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I hadn&rsquo;t ever heard a word from or about Emily till I come home from the back field Saturday and found her scrubbing the floor but with the first decent dinner I&rsquo;d had since she left me all ready on the table. She told me to eat it first and then we&rsquo;d talk . . . by which I concluded that Emily had learned some lessons about getting along with a man. So she&rsquo;s here and she&rsquo;s going to stay . . . seeing that Ginger&rsquo;s dead and the Island&rsquo;s some bigger than she thought. There&rsquo;s Mrs. Lynde and her now. No, don&rsquo;t go, Anne. Stay and get acquainted with Emily. She took quite a notion to you Saturday . . . wanted to know who that handsome redhaired girl was at the next house.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
