Under Mr. Irving&rsquo;s praise Anne&rsquo;s face &ldquo;burst flower like into rosy bloom,&rdquo; and the busy, weary man of the world, looking at her, thought he had never seen a fairer, sweeter slip of girlhood than this little &ldquo;down east&rdquo; schoolteacher with her red hair and wonderful eyes.</p><p>Paul sat between them blissfully happy.</p><p>&ldquo;I never dreamed father was coming,&rdquo; he said radiantly. &ldquo;Even Grandma didn&rsquo;t know it.
