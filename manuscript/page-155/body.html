<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I want to do my share of honest, real work in the world, Anne . . . add a little to the sum of human knowledge that all the good men have been accumulating since it began. The folks who lived before me have done so much for me that I want to show my gratitude by doing something for the folks who will live after me. It seems to me that is the only way a fellow can get square with his obligations to the race.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to add some beauty to life,&rdquo; said Anne dreamily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly want to make people KNOW more . . . though I know that IS the noblest ambition . . . but I&rsquo;d love to make them have a pleasanter time because of me . . . to have some little joy or happy thought that would never have existed if I hadn&rsquo;t been born.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
