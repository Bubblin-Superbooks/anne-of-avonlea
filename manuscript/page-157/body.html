She went to see Mrs. Keith this evening and she will soon be back.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne had tea ready when Marilla came home; the fire was crackling cheerily, a vase of frost-bleached ferns and ruby-red maple leaves adorned the table, and delectable odors of ham and toast pervaded the air. But Marilla sank into her chair with a deep sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Are your eyes troubling you? Does your head ache?&rdquo; queried Anne anxiously.</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m only tired . . . and worried. It&rsquo;s about Mary and those children . . . Mary is worse . . . she can&rsquo;t last much longer. And as for the twins, I don&rsquo;t know what is to become of them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
