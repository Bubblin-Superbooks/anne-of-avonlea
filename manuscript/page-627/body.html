<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But I s&rsquo;pose, Anne, to be fair, I was cantankerous too. I didn&rsquo;t try to improve as I might have done . . . I just got cranky and disagreeable when she found fault. I told her one day she hadn&rsquo;t complained of my grammar when I proposed to her. It wasn&rsquo;t an overly tactful thing to say. A woman would forgive a man for beating her sooner than for hinting she was too much pleased to get him. Well, we bickered along like that and it wasn&rsquo;t exactly pleasant, but we might have got used to each other after a spell if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Ginger. Ginger was the rock we split on at last. Emily didn&rsquo;t like parrots and she couldn&rsquo;t stand Ginger&rsquo;s profane habits of speech. I was attached to the bird for my brother the sailor&rsquo;s sake. My brother the sailor was a pet of mine when we were little tads and he&rsquo;d sent Ginger to me when he was dying.</p></div> </div>
