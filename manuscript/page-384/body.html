<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> someone might slip on them. I&rsquo;ll have a light soup to begin with . . . you know I can make lovely cream-of-onion soup . . . and then a couple of roast fowls. I&rsquo;ll have the two white roosters. I have real affection for those roosters and they&rsquo;ve been pets ever since the gray hen hatched out just the two of them . . . little balls of yellow down. But I know they would have to be sacrificed sometime, and surely there couldn&rsquo;t be a worthier occasion than this. But oh, Marilla, I cannot kill them . . . not even for Mrs. Morgan&rsquo;s sake. I&rsquo;ll have to ask John Henry Carter to come over and do it for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; volunteered Davy, &ldquo;if Marilla&rsquo;ll hold them by the legs, &lsquo;cause I guess it&rsquo;d take both my hands to manage the axe. It&rsquo;s awful jolly fun to see them hopping about after their heads are cut off.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
