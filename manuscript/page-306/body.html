Now, Diana.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Long ago,&rdquo; began Diana, &ldquo;this farm belonged to old Mr. David Gray. He didn&rsquo;t live on it . . . he lived where Silas Sloane lives now. He had one son, Jordan, and he went up to Boston one winter to work and while he was there he fell in love with a girl named Hester Murray. She was working in a store and she hated it. She&rsquo;d been brought up in the country and she always wanted to get back. When Jordan asked her to marry him she said she would if he&rsquo;d take her away to some quiet spot where she&rsquo;d see nothing but fields and trees. So he brought her to Avonlea.</p></div> </div>
