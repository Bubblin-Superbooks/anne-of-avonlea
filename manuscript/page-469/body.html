<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You know, teacher. But I tried again quite patiently. I said, &lsquo;Well then, Mary Joe, do you know what I think? I think an angel walks over the world after the sun sets . . . a great, tall, white angel, with silvery folded wings . . . and sings the flowers and birds to sleep. Children can hear him if they know how to listen.&rsquo; Then Mary Joe held up her hands all over flour and said, &lsquo;Well, yous are de queer leetle boy. Yous make me feel scare.&rsquo; And she really did looked scared. I went out then and whispered the rest of my thoughts to the garden. There was a little birch tree in the garden and it died. Grandma says the salt spray killed it; but I think the dryad belonging to it was a foolish dryad who wandered away to see the world and got lost. And the little tree was so lonely it died of a broken heart.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
