<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> but you can wriggle your legs about under the desk and that helps a lot. It&rsquo;s splendid to have so many boys to play with. I sit with Milty Boulter and he&rsquo;s fine. He&rsquo;s longer than me but I&rsquo;m wider. It&rsquo;s nicer to sit in the back seats but you can&rsquo;t sit there till your legs grow long enough to touch the floor. Milty drawed a picture of Anne on his slate and it was awful ugly and I told him if he made pictures of Anne like that I&rsquo;d lick him at recess. I thought first I&rsquo;d draw one of him and put horns and a tail on it, but I was afraid it would hurt his feelings, and Anne says you should never hurt anyone&rsquo;s feelings. It seems it&rsquo;s dreadful to have your feelings hurt. It&rsquo;s better to knock a boy down than hurt his feelings if you MUST do something.</p></div> </div>
