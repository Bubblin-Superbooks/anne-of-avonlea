<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; said Mr. Harrison briskly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say another word about it, miss. It&rsquo;s of no consequence . . . no consequence whatever. Accidents will happen. I&rsquo;m too hasty myself sometimes, miss . . . far too hasty. But I can&rsquo;t help speaking out just what I think and folks must take me as they find me. If that cow had been in my cabbages now . . . but never mind, she wasn&rsquo;t, so it&rsquo;s all right. I think I&rsquo;d rather have your cow in exchange, since you want to be rid of her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Mr. Harrison. I&rsquo;m so glad you are not vexed. I was afraid you would be.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
