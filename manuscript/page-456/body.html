<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the afternoon Anne walked down to the old Irving place to see Paul. She found him stretched out on the grassy bank beside the thick fir grove that sheltered the house on the north, absorbed in a book of fairy tales. He sprang up radiantly at sight of her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come, teacher,&rdquo; he said eagerly, &ldquo;because Grandma&rsquo;s away. You&rsquo;ll stay and have tea with me, won&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s so lonesome to have tea all by oneself. YOU know, teacher. I&rsquo;ve had serious thoughts of asking Young Mary Joe to sit down and eat her tea with me, but I expect Grandma wouldn&rsquo;t approve. She says the French have to be kept in their place. And anyhow, it&rsquo;s difficult to talk with Young Mary Joe. She just laughs and says, &lsquo;Well, yous do beat all de kids I ever knowed.&rsquo; That isn&rsquo;t my idea of conversation.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
