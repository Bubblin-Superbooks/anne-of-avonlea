<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I asked them to tell me the things they most wanted. Some of the answers were commonplace enough . . . dolls, ponies, and skates. Others were decidedly original. Hester Boulter wanted &lsquo;to wear her Sunday dress every day and eat in the sitting room.&rsquo; Hannah Bell wanted &lsquo;to be good without having to take any trouble about it.&rsquo; Marjory White, aged ten, wanted to be a WIDOW. Questioned why, she gravely said that if you weren&rsquo;t married people called you an old maid, and if you were your husband bossed you; but if you were a widow there&rsquo;d be no danger of either. The most remarkable wish was Sally Bell&rsquo;s. She wanted a &lsquo;honeymoon.&rsquo; I asked her if she knew what it was and she said she thought it was an extra nice kind of bicycle because her cousin in Montreal went on a honeymoon when he was married and he had always had the very latest in bicycles!</p></div> </div>
