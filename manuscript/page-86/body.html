It&rsquo;s the shortest and easiest way of convincing them.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne gave Gilbert a disappointed glance.</p><p>&ldquo;I shall never whip a child,&rdquo; she repeated firmly. &ldquo;I feel sure it isn&rsquo;t either right or necessary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something?&rdquo; said Jane.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d keep him in after school and talk kindly and firmly to him,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;There is some good in every person if you can find it. It is a teacher&rsquo;s duty to find and develop it. That is what our School Management professor at Queen&rsquo;s told us, you know. Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him? It&rsquo;s far more important to influence the children aright than it is even to teach them the three R&rsquo;s, Professor Rennie says.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
