<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anne candidly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that you and he were engaged once.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So we were . . . twenty-five years ago . . . a lifetime ago. And we were to have been married the next spring. I had my wedding dress made, although nobody but mother and Stephen ever knew THAT. We&rsquo;d been engaged in a way almost all our lives, you might say. When Stephen was a little boy his mother would bring him here when she came to see my mother; and the second time he ever came . . . he was nine and I was six . . . he told me out in the garden that he had pretty well made up his mind to marry me when he grew up. I remember that I said &lsquo;Thank you&rsquo;; and when he was gone I told mother very gravely that there was a great weight off my mind, because I wasn&rsquo;t frightened any more about having to be an old maid. How poor mother laughed!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
