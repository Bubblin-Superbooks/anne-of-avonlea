<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Why is it that they never seem to think it a duty to tell you the pleasant things they hear about you? Mrs. H. B. DonNELL called at the school again yesterday and told me she thought it HER duty to inform me that Mrs. Harmon Andrew didn&rsquo;t approve of my reading fairy tales to the children, and that Mr. Rogerson thought Prillie wasn&rsquo;t coming on fast enough in arithmetic. If Prillie would spend less time making eyes at the boys over her slate she might do better. I feel quite sure that Jack Gillis works her class sums for her, though I&rsquo;ve never been able to catch him red-handed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you succeeded in reconciling Mrs. DonNELL&rsquo;s hopeful son to his saintly name?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
