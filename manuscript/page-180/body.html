Every head in the congregation flew up. Lauretta White was dancing up and down in her pew, clutching frantically at the back of her dress.</p><p>&ldquo;Ow . . . mommer . . . mommer . . . ow . . . take it off . . . ow . . . get it out . . . ow . . . that bad boy put it down my neck . . . ow . . . mommer . . . it&rsquo;s going further down . . . ow . . . ow . . . ow. . . .&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. White rose and with a set face carried the hysterical, writhing Lauretta out of church. Her shrieks died away in the distance and Mr. Allan proceeded with the service. But everybody felt that it was a failure that day. For the first time in her life Marilla took no notice of the text and Anne sat with scarlet cheeks of mortification.</p></div> </div>
