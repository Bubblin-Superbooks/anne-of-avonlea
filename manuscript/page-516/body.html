I feel as if she were holding it out to my lips like a cup of airy wine and I&rsquo;ll take a sip at every step.&rdquo;</p><p>Perhaps it was because she was so absorbed in &ldquo;drinking it in&rdquo; that Anne took the left turning when they came to a fork in the road. She should have taken the right, but ever afterward she counted it the most fortunate mistake of her life. They came out finally to a lonely, grassy road, with nothing in sight along it but ranks of spruce saplings.</p></div> </div>
