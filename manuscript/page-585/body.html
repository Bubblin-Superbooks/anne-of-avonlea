<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Dora planted, weeded, and watered carefully, systematically, and dispassionately. As a result, her plot was already green with prim, orderly little rows of vegetables and annuals. Davy, however, worked with more zeal than discretion; he dug and hoed and raked and watered and transplanted so energetically that his seeds had no chance for their lives.</p><p>&ldquo;How is your garden coming on, Davy-boy?&rdquo; asked Anne.</p><p>&ldquo;Kind of slow,&rdquo; said Davy with a sigh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why the things don&rsquo;t grow better. Milty Boulter says I must have planted them in the dark of the moon and that&rsquo;s the whole trouble. He says you must never sow seeds or kill pork or cut your hair or do any &lsquo;portant thing in the wrong time of the moon. Is that true, Anne? I want to know.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
