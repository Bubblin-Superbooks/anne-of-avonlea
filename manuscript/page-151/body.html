Why, Anne, I&rsquo;ve learned more in the weeks I&rsquo;ve been teaching the young ideas of White Sands than I learned in all the years I went to school myself. We all seem to be getting on pretty well. The Newbridge people like Jane, I hear; and I think White Sands is tolerably satisfied with your humble servant . . . all except Mr. Andrew Spencer. I met Mrs. Peter Blewett on my way home last night and she told me she thought it her duty to inform me that Mr. Spencer didn&rsquo;t approve of my methods.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you ever noticed,&rdquo; asked Anne reflectively, &ldquo;that when people say it is their duty to tell you a certain thing you may prepare for something disagreeable?</p></div> </div>
