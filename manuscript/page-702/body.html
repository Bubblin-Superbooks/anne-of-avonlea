I never knew a young person with white hair. But your eyes are as young as my beautiful teacher&rsquo;s when you laugh. I tell you what, Miss Lavendar&rdquo; . . . Paul&rsquo;s voice and face were as solemn as a judge&rsquo;s . . . &ldquo;I think you would make a splendid mother. You have just the right look in your eyes . . . the look my little mother always had. I think it&rsquo;s a pity you haven&rsquo;t any boys of your own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a little dream boy, Paul.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
