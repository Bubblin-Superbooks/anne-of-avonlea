<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Trees haven&rsquo;t souls,&rdquo; said practical Diana, &ldquo;but the smell of dead fir is certainly lovely. I&rsquo;m going to make a cushion and fill it with fir needles. You&rsquo;d better make one too, Anne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I shall . . . and use it for my naps. I&rsquo;d be certain to dream I was a dryad or a woodnymph then. But just this minute I&rsquo;m well content to be Anne Shirley, Avonlea schoolma&rsquo;am, driving over a road like this on such a sweet, friendly day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely day but we have anything but a lovely task before us,&rdquo; sighed Diana. &ldquo;Why on earth did you offer to canvass this road, Anne? Almost all the cranks in Avonlea live along it, and we&rsquo;ll probably be treated as if we were begging for ourselves. It&rsquo;s the very worst road of all.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
