Lost!&rdquo; Anne looked at Davy, who was swinging on the yard gate, and detected merriment in his eyes. &ldquo;Davy, do you know where she is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Davy stoutly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her since dinner time, cross my heart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been away ever since one o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;Thomas Lynde took sick all of a sudden and Rachel sent up for me to go at once. When I left here Dora was playing with her doll in the kitchen and Davy was making mud pies behind the barn. I only got home half an hour ago . . . and no Dora to be seen. Davy declares he never saw her since I left.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
