<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Diana shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;I never imagine things like that about places now, Anne. Don&rsquo;t you remember how cross mother and Marilla were when we imagined ghosts into the Haunted Wood? To this day I can&rsquo;t go through that bush comfortably after dark; and if I began imagining such things about the old Boulter house I&rsquo;d be frightened to pass it too. Besides, those children aren&rsquo;t dead. They&rsquo;re all grown up and doing well . . . and one of them is a butcher. And flowers and songs couldn&rsquo;t have ghosts anyhow.&rdquo;</p><p>Anne smothered a little sigh. She loved Diana dearly and they had always been good comrades. But she had long ago learned that when she wandered into the realm of fancy she must go alone. The way to it was by an enchanted path where not even her dearest might follow her.</p></div> </div>
