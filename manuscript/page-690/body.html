<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh . . . hoo . . . hoo . . . hoo,&rdquo; went Paul on the dyke, where he had been making noises diligently . . . not all of them melodious in the making, but all coming back transmuted into the very gold and silver of sound by the fairy alchemists over the river. Miss Lavendar made an impatient movement with her pretty hands.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just tired of everything . . . even of the echoes. There is nothing in my life but echoes . . . echoes of lost hopes and dreams and joys. They&rsquo;re beautiful and mocking. Oh Anne, it&rsquo;s horrid of me to talk like this when I have company. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m getting old and it doesn&rsquo;t agree with me. I know I&rsquo;ll be fearfully cranky by the time I&rsquo;m sixty. But perhaps all I need is a course of blue pills.</p></div> </div>
