Deliberately she laid them down one by one on the porch floor and the porch steps, and then down the path to the very feet of her mystified callers.</p><p>&ldquo;Will you please wipe your feet carefully on the grass and then walk on these papers?&rdquo; she said anxiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just swept the house all over and I can&rsquo;t have any more dust tracked in.
