You needn&rsquo;t look so delighted, Anne. It will mean a good deal of extra work for you. I can&rsquo;t sew a stitch on account of my eyes, so you&rsquo;ll have to see to the making and mending of their clothes. And you don&rsquo;t like sewing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hate it,&rdquo; said Anne calmly, &ldquo;but if you are willing to take those children from a sense of duty surely I can do their sewing from a sense of duty. It does people good to have to do things they don&rsquo;t like . . . in moderation.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
