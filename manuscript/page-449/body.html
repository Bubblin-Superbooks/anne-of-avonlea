Well, what will you give for it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty dollars,&rdquo; said Anne, who was never meant to match business wits with a Copp, or she would not have offered her price at the start.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said Miss Sarah cautiously. &ldquo;That platter is mine fortunately, or I&rsquo;d never dare to sell it when Martha wasn&rsquo;t here. As it is, I daresay she&rsquo;ll raise a fuss. Martha&rsquo;s the boss of this establishment I can tell you. I&rsquo;m getting awful tired of living under another woman&rsquo;s thumb. But come in, come in. You must be real tired and hungry. I&rsquo;ll do the best I can for you in the way of tea but I warn you not to expect anything but bread and butter and some cowcumbers.</p></div> </div>
