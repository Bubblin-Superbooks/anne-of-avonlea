<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Rachel and I have decided to have our cruise to town tomorrow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr. Lynde is feeling better this week and Rachel wants to go before he has another sick spell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I intend to get up extra early tomorrow morning, for I&rsquo;ve ever so much to do,&rdquo; said Anne virtuously. &ldquo;For one thing, I&rsquo;m going to shift the feathers from my old bedtick to the new one. I ought to have done it long ago but I&rsquo;ve just kept putting it off . . . it&rsquo;s such a detestable task. It&rsquo;s a very bad habit to put off disagreeable things, and I never mean to again, or else I can&rsquo;t comfortably tell my pupils not to do it. That would be inconsistent. Then I want to make a cake for Mr. Harrison and finish my paper on gardens for the A.V.I.S., and write Stella, and wash and starch my muslin dress, and make Dora&rsquo;s new apron.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
