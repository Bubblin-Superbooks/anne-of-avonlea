<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The idea of a woman of forty-five playing at having a tea party, just as if she were a little girl! But Anne of the shining eyes exclaimed joyfuly, &ldquo;Oh, do YOU imagine things too?&rdquo;</p><p>That &ldquo;too&rdquo; revealed a kindred spirit to Miss Lavendar.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; she confessed, boldly. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s silly in anybody as old as I am. But what is the use of being an independent old maid if you can&rsquo;t be silly when you want to, and when it doesn&rsquo;t hurt anybody? A person must have some compensations. I don&rsquo;t believe I could live at times if I didn&rsquo;t pretend things. I&rsquo;m not often caught at it though, and Charlotta the Fourth never tells. But I&rsquo;m glad to be caught today, for you have really come and I have tea all ready for you.</p></div> </div>
